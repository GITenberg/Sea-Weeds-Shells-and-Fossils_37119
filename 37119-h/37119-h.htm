<p>Alg&aelig;, popularly known as sea-weeds, although many species
are inhabitants of fresh water, or grow on moist ground, may
be briefly described as cellular, flowerless plants, having no
proper roots, but imbibing nutriment by their whole surface
from the medium in which they grow. As far as has been
ascertained, the total number of species is about 9000 or 10,000.
Many of them are microscopic, as the Desmids and Diatoms,
others, as Lessonia, and some of the larger Laminari&aelig; (oarweeds),
are arborescent, covering the bed of the sea around the coast
with a submarine forest; while in the Pacific, off the northwestern
shores of America, Nereocystis, a genus allied to Laminaria,
has a stem over 300 feet in length, which, although not
thicker than whipcord, is stout enough to moor a bladder, barrel-shaped,
six or seven feet long, and crowned with a tuft of fifty
leaves or more, each from thirty to forty feet in length. This
vegetable buoy is a favourite resting place of the sea otter; and
where the plant exists in any quantity, the surface of the sea is
rendered impassable to boats. The stem of Macrocystis, which
"girds the globe in the southern temperate zone," is stated to
extend sometimes to the enormous length of 1500 feet. It is
no thicker than the finger anywhere, and the upper branches
are as slender as pack-thread; but at the base of each leaf there
is placed a buoy, in the shape of a vesicle filled with air.</p>

<p>Although the worthlessness of Alg&aelig; has been proverbial, as
in the "alga inutile" of Horace and Virgil's "projecta vilior
alga," they are not without importance in botanical economics.
A dozen or more species found in the British seas are made
use of, raw or prepared in several ways, as food for man.
Of these edible Alg&aelig;, Dr. Harvey considers the two species
of Porphyra, or laver, the most valuable. Berkeley says, "The
best way of preparing this vegetable or condiment, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
is extremely wholesome, is to heat it thoroughly with a little
strong gravy or broth, adding, before it is served on toast, a
small quantity of butter and lemon juice." A species of Nostoc
is largely consumed in China as an ingredient in soup. A
similar use is made of Enteromorpha intestinalis in Japan.
Many species of fish and other animals, turtle included, live upon
sea-weed. Fucus vesiculosus is a grateful food for cattle. In
Norway, cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs are largely fed upon it,
and on our own coasts cattle eagerly browse on that and kindred
species at low water. In some northern countries, Fucus serratus
sprinkled with meal is used as winter fodder.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Group of Sea-weeds (chiefly Laminari&aelig;).</span>
</div>

<p>All the marine Alg&aelig; contain iodine; and even before the value
of that substance in glandular complaints had been ascertained,
stems of a sea-weed were chewed as a remedy by the inhabitants
of certain districts of South America where goître is prevalent.
Chondrus crispus and (Gigartina) mamillosa constitute the Irish
moss of commerce, which dissolves into a nutritious and delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
jelly, and the restorative value of which in consumption doubtless
depends in some degree on the presence of iodine. The freshwater
Alg&aelig; not only furnish abundant and nourishing food to the fish
and other animals living in ponds and streams, but by their
action in the decomposition of carburetted hydrogen and other
noxious gases purify the element in which they live, thus becoming
important sanitary agents. The value of aquatic plants
in the aquarium is well known. A Chinese species of Gigartina
is much employed as a glue and varnish; and also much used in
China in the manufacture of lanterns and transparencies, and in
that country and Japan for glazing windows. Handles for
table knives and forks, tools, and other implements have been
made from the thick stems of oarweeds, and fishing lines from
Chorda filum. Tripoli powder, extensively used for polishing,
consists mainly of the silicious shells of Diatoms. On various
parts of our coast, the coarser species of sea-weed, now used as
a valuable manure, were formerly extensively burnt for kelp,
an impure carbonate of soda. This industry, when carried on
upon a large scale, became a fruitful source of income to some
of the poorest districts in the kingdom, bringing, in the last
decade of last century, nearly £30,000 per annum into Orkney
alone. Since the production of soda from rock salt has become
general, kelp is now only burnt for the extraction of iodine, this
being the easiest way of obtaining that substance.</p>

<p>Although the vegetable structure and mode of reproduction
are essentially the same in all Alg&aelig;, as regards the former they
vary from the simple cell, through cells arranged in threads,
to a stem and leaves simulating the vegetation of higher
tribes. And although the simpler kinds are obviously formed
of threads, most of the more compound may also be resolved
into the same structure by maceration in hot water or diluted
muriatic acid. In substance some are mere masses of slime or
jelly, others are silky to the feel, horny, cartilaginous or leather-like,
and even apparently woody. A few species secrete carbonate
of lime from the water, laying it up in their tissues;
others cover themselves completely with that mineral, while
some coat themselves with silex or flint. Many Alg&aelig; are
beautifully coloured, even when growing at depths to which
very little light penetrates. As in their vegetative organs, so in
their reproductive, Alg&aelig; exhibit many modifications of structure
without much real difference. In the green sea-weeds
reproduction is effected by simple cell division in the unicellular
species, and by spores resulting from the union of the
contents of two cells in the others. The red sea-weeds have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
double system of reproduction, a distinctly sexual one, by spores
and antheridia, and another by tetraspores, which by some are
considered to be of the nature of gemm&aelig;, or buds. The spores
are generally situated in distinct hollow conceptacles (favell&aelig;,
ceramidium, coccidium). The tetraspore is also sometimes contained
in a conceptacle. It consists of a more or less globular,
transparent cell, which when mature contains within it four
(rarely three) sporules. Reproduction in the olive sea-weeds is
also double, by zoospores, generally considered gemm&aelig;, and by
spores and antherozoids, which is a sexual process.</p>

</div>

<p>Following the classification adopted by Professor Harvey,
which is that generally employed in English systematic manuals,
we divide the order into three sub-orders, named from the prevailing
colour of their spores. 1. Chlorosperme&aelig;, with green
spores; 2. Rhodosperme&aelig;, with red spores; and 3. Melanosperme&aelig;,
with olive-coloured spores. The entire plant in the
first group is usually grass-green, but occasionally olive, purple,
blue, and sometimes almost black; in the second it is some shade
or other of red, very seldom green; and in the third, while
generally olive green, it is occasionally brown olive or yellow.</p>

<p>The Chlorosperme&aelig; are extremely varied in form, often
threadlike, and are propagated either by the simple division of
the contents of their cells (endochrome), by the transformation
of particular joints, or by the change of the contents of the cells
into zoospores, which are cells moving freely in water by means
of hairlike appendages. In their lower forms they are among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
the most rudimentary of all plants, and thus of special interest
physiologically, as representing the component parts of which
higher plants are formed. They are subdivided into twelve
groups, as follows:</p>

<p>The first group, Palmelle&aelig;, are unicellular plants, the cells of
which are either free or surrounded by a gelatinous mass, and
they are propagated by the division of the endochrome. One
of the most remarkable of the species of this family is Protococcus
cruentus, which is found at the foot of walls having a northern
aspect, looking as if blood had been poured out on the ground
or on stones. Protococcus nivalis, again, is the cause of the red
snow, of which early arctic navigators used to give such marvellous
accounts. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_2">Fig. 2.</a>)</span></p>

<a name="Sect_1_Fig_3"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/pg_07.png" width="335" height="162" alt="Fig. 3. A, Fragment of a Filament of Zygnema, one of the Conjugate&aelig;; B, Closterium; C, Euastrium; two desmids." title="Fig. 3.

<span class="caption">Fig. 3. A, Fragment of a Filament of Zygnema, one of the Conjugate&aelig;;<br />B, Closterium; C, Euastrium; two desmids.</span>
</div>

<p>The Desmideace&aelig;, together with the plants of the next succeeding
group, are favourite subjects of investigation or observation by
the possessors of microscopes, an attention they merit from the
beauty and variety of their forms. They are minute plants
of a green colour, consisting of cells generally independent
of each other, but sometimes forming brittle threads or minute
fronds, and are reproduced by spores generated by the conjugation
of two distinct individuals. The process of conjugation in
Desmids and Diatoms consists in the union of the endochrome
of two individuals, each of which in these families is composed
of a single cell. This ultimately forms a rounded body or resting
spore, which afterwards germinates, the resulting plant not
however acquiring the normal form until the third generation.
<span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_3">Fig. 3.</a>)</span></p>

<p>The Diatomace&aelig;, closely allied to the preceding group in
structure and reproduction, are however distinguished from them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
by their flinty shells, which are often beautifully sculptured.
Their endochrome is a golden brown, instead of green as in the
Desmideace&aelig;. The latter, also, are confined to fresh water, while
the Diatomace&aelig; are found, though not exclusively, in the sea,
where their shells sometimes, microscopically minute as they are
individually, form banks extending several hundred miles. It is
stated that in the collection made by Sir Joseph Hooker in the
Himalayas the species closely resemble our own.</p>

<p>In the next group, Confervace&aelig;, we are introduced to forms
more like the general notion of what a plant should be. The
individuals of which it consists are composed of threads, jointed,
either simple or branched, mostly of a grass-green colour, and
propagating either by minute zoospores or by metamorphosed
joints. They are found both in fresh and salt water, and in
damp situations. The number of species is very great.
A considerable number consist of unbranched threads; the
branched forms grow sometimes so densely as to assume the
form of solid balls. After floods, when the water stands for
several days, they sometimes increase to such an extent, as to
form on its subsidence a uniform paper-like stratum, which while
decomposing is extremely disagreeable. The name Conferva
has been almost discontinued as a generic title, the majority of
British species being now ranged under Clado- and Ch&aelig;to-phora.
The latter are branched, and require great care and attention in
order to distinguish them, on account of their general resemblance
to each other. Good characters are however to be found
in their mode of branching and the form and comparative size
of the terminal joints.</p>

<p>The Batrachosperme&aelig; constitute a small but very beautiful
group, consisting of gelatinous threads variously woven into a
branched cylindrical frond. The branches are sometimes arranged,
as in the British species, so that the plants appear like
necklaces. In colour they pass from green, through intermediate
shades of olive and purple, to black. In common with some of
the higher Alg&aelig;, the threads of the superficial branches send
joints down the stem, changing it from simple to compound.
The native species are all fluviatile.</p>

<p>The Hydrodicte&aelig; are among the most remarkable of Alg&aelig;.
Hydrodictyon utriculatum, the solitary British species, is found
in the large pond at Hampton Court, and in similar situations
in various parts of the country, but not very generally. It resembles
a green purse or net, from four to six inches in length,
with delicate and regular meshes, the reticulations being about
four lines long. Its method of reproduction is no less remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
than its form. Each of the cells forms within itself an enormous
mass of small elliptic grains. These become attached by the
extremities so as to form a network inside the cell, and, its walls
being dissolved, a new plant is set free to grow to the size of the
parent Hydrodictyon.</p>

<p>The Nostochine&aelig; grow in fresh water, or attached to moist
soil. They consist of slender, beaded threads surrounded by a
firm jelly, and often spreading into large, wavy fronds. The
larger beads on the inclosed threads are reproductive spores.
<span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_4">Fig. 4, A.</a>)</span></p>

<a name="Sect_1_Fig_4"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/pg_09.png" width="279" height="102" alt="Fig. 4. A, Fragment of a Filament of Nostoc. B, End of a Filament of Oscillatoria." title="Fig. 4. A, Fragment of a Filament of Nostoc. B, End of a Filament of Oscillatoria." /><br />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4. A, Fragment of a Filament of Nostoc. B, End of a Filament of Oscillatoria.</span>
</div>

<p>The Oscillatore&aelig; are another remarkable group, on account
of the peculiar animal-like motions they exhibit. They occur
both in salt and fresh water, and on almost every kind of site
in which there is sufficient moisture. The threads of which they
are composed are jointed, and generally unbranched; they are
of various tints of blue, red, and green, and, where their fructification
has been ascertained, are propagated by cell division.
The most curious point about them is, however, the movements
of their fronds. According to Dr. Harvey, these are of three
kinds&mdash;a pendulum-like movement from side to side, performed
by one end, whilst the other remains fixed, so as to form
a pivot; a movement of flexure of the filament itself, the oscillating
extremity bending over from one side to the other, like
the head of a worm or caterpillar seeking something on its line
of march; and lastly, a simple onward movement of progression,
the whole phenomenon being, Dr. Harvey thinks, resolvable
into a spiral onward movement of the filament. Whatever
is the cause of this motion, it is not, as used to be supposed,
of an animal nature; for the individuals of this group are undoubted
plants. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_4">Fig. 4, B.</a>)</span> Several species of Rivularia,
belonging to the Oscillatore&aelig;, are found both in the sea and
in fresh water. They are gelatinous, and have something of the
appearance of Nostoc, in aspect as well as in minute structure.</p>

<p>The Conjugat&aelig; are freshwater articulated Alg&aelig;, which reproduce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
themselves by the union of two endochromes. They are
very interesting objects under the microscope, owing to the
spiral or zigzag arrangement of the endochrome of many of
them, and the delicacy of all.</p>

<p>The Bulboch&aelig;te&aelig; constitute a small group, some half-a-dozen
species being British. They are freshwater plants, composed
of articulate branched filaments, with fertile bulbshaped
branchlets. The endochrome is believed to be fertilized by
bodies developed in antheridia, the contents of each fertilized
cell dividing into four ovate zoospores.</p>

<p>The last two groups of green sea-weeds consist chiefly of
marine plants. Of these the first, Siphone&aelig;, is so called because
the plant, however complicated, is composed invariably of a single
cell. It propagates by minute zoospores, by large quiescent
spores, or by large active spores clothed with cilia. It includes
the remarkable genus Codium, three species of which inhabit
the British seas. In Codium Bursa the filamentous frond is
spherical and hollow, presenting more the appearance of a
round sponge or puff-ball than a sea-weed, and is somewhat
rare. Another species greatly resembles a branched sponge,
and the third forms a velvety crust on the surface of rocks.
Another genus, Vaucheria, is of a beautiful green colour, forming
a velvety surface on moist soil, on mud-covered rocks overflowed
by the tide, or parasitic on other sea-weeds. The most
attractive plants of this family are however those of the genus
Bryopsis, two of which are found on the British shores. The
most common one is B. plumosa, the fronds of which grow
usually in the shady and sheltered sides of rock pools.</p>

<p>The fronds of the last of the green-weed groups, the Ulvace&aelig;,
are membranous, and either flat or tubular. Two of them, Ulva
latissima, the green, and Porphyra laciniata, the purple laver, are
among the most common sea-weeds, growing well up from low-water
mark. The propagation in all of them is by zoospores.
An allied genus, Enteromorpha, is protean in its forms, which
have been classed under many species. They may, however, be
reduced to half a dozen. Some of them are very slender, so as
almost to be mistaken for confervoid plants.</p>

<p>With the Rhodosperme&aelig; we enter a sub-order of Alg&aelig;, exclusively
marine, the plants in which have always held out great
attractions to the collector. In structure they are expanded or
filamentous, nearly always rose-coloured or purple in colour. Of
the fourteen groups into which they are divided by Harvey, the
first is Ceramiace&aelig;, articulate Alg&aelig;, constituting a large proportion
of the marine plants of our shores. Of the genus Ceramium,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
C. rubrum is the most frequent, and it is found in every latitude,
almost from pole to pole. It is very variable in aspect, but can
always be recognized by its fruit. C. diaphanum is a very handsome
species, growing often in rock pools along with the other.
There are about fifteen native species altogether, some of them
rare, and all very beautiful, both as displayed on paper and seen
under the microscope. Crouania attenuata is a beautiful plant,
parasitic upon a Cladostephus or Corallina officinalis. It is however
extremely rare, being only found in England about Land's
End. A more common and conspicuous, but equally handsome
plant is Ptilota plumosa <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>)</span>, which is mostly confined to our
northern coasts; although P. sericea, a smaller species, or variety,
is common in the south, and easily distinguished from its congener,
which it otherwise greatly resembles, by its jointed branchlets
and pinnules. Callithamnion, Halurus and Griffithsia, articulate
like Ceramium, furnish also several handsome species. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_8">Fig. 5.</a>)</span></p>

<p>The group Spyridiace&aelig; contains only one English plant, Spyridia
filamentosa, which is curiously and irregularly branched, the
branches being articulate and of a pinky red. One of its kinds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
of fruit, consisting of crimson spores, is contained in a transparent
network basket, formed by the favell&aelig;, or short branches,
whence its name.</p>

<p>The Cryptonemiace&aelig; are very numerous in genera and species.
They all have inarticulate branches, some are thread-like. Grateloupia
filicina is a neat little plant, met with rarely on the
south and west coasts. Gigartina mamillosa, a common plant
everywhere, is the plant sold, along with Chondrus crispus, as
Irish or Carrageen moss. A handsome little plant, Stenogramme
interrupta, is very rare, but it has been gathered both on the
Irish and English coasts. The Phyllophor&aelig;, one species of
which is frequent on all our shores, may be recognised by the
way in which the points and surfaces of their fronds throw
out proliferous leaves. Gymnogongrus has two British species,
one much resembling Chondrus crispus, already named, of
which it was formerly considered a congener. Their fructification
is however very different. Ahnfeltia plicata is a curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
wiry, entangled plant, almost black in colour, and like horsehair
when dry, and can scarcely be mistaken. Cystoclonium
purpurascens is very commonly cast up by the tide on most
of our coasts. It varies in colour, but is easily distinguished
by the spore-bearing tubercles imbedded in its slender branches.
Callophyllis laciniata is a handsome species, of a rich crimson
colour, and sometimes a foot square. It can scarcely have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
escaped the notice of the sea-side visitor, for it is widely distributed
and often thrown out in great abundance; one writer
describes the shore near Tynemouth as having been red for
upwards of a mile with this superb sea-weed. Kalymenia
reniformis is another of the broad, flat Alg&aelig;, but it is scarcer,
and of a colour not so conspicuous. Among the most frequent
of our sea-weeds, both as growing in the rock pools and cast
ashore, is Chondrus crispus, already twice referred to in connexion
with its officinal uses. It is very variable in form, one
author figuring as many as thirty-six different varieties. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_6">Fig. 6.</a>)</span>
Chylocladia clavellosa, which is sometimes cast ashore a <ins title='Correction - was "fond"'>foot</ins>
and a half long, is closely set with branches, and these again
clothed with branchlets in one or two series. The whole plant
is fleshy, of a rose-red or brilliant pink colour, turning to golden
yellow in decay. There is another small species, confined to
the extreme north of Britain. Halymenia ligulata is another
flat red weed, but sometimes very narrow in its ramifications.
Furcellaria fastigiata has a round, branched, taper stem, swollen
at the summit, which contains the fruit, consisting of masses of
tetraspores in a pod-like receptacle. Schizymenia edulis, better
known perhaps by its old name Iridea, is a flat, inversely egg-shaped
leaf with scarcely any stem. It is one of the edible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
Alg&aelig;, and pretty frequent in shady rock pools. Gloiosiphonia
capillaris is a remarkably beautiful plant, and not common,
being confined to certain parts of the southern coasts. The
stem is very soft and gelatinous; the spores are produced in red
globular masses imbedded in the marginal filaments, which have
a fine appearance under the microscope when fresh.</p>

<p>The Rhodomeniace&aelig; are purplish or blood-red sea-weeds,
inarticulate, membranaceous, and cellular. Among the dark-coloured
is Rhodomenia palmata, better known as dulse, a
common and edible species. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_7">Fig. 7.</a>)</span> Wormskioldia sanguinea
is not only the most beautiful sea-weed, but the finest of all
leaves or fronds. It is usually about six inches long, but sometimes
nearly double that length and six inches broad, with a
distinct midrib and branching veins, and a delicate wavy lamina,
pink or deep red. The fruit is produced in winter from small
leaflets growing upon the bare midrib. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_8">Fig. 8.</a></span>) The commonest
of all red sea-weeds on our coast, one of the most elegant,
and much sought after by sea-weed picture makers, Plocamium
coccineum, belongs to this group. Calliblepharis ciliata and
jubata are coarser plants, the latter being the more frequent.
They were formerly included in the genus Rhodymenia, from
which they were removed when their fruit was better understood.</p>

<p>Wrangelia and Naccaria are the only British genera in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
Wrangeliace&aelig;. There is only one native species in each, both
being rare, the latter especially.</p>

<p>The Helminthocladi&aelig; are also a limited group, of a gelatinous
structure; so much so that on being gathered they feel like a
bunch of slimy worms, whence the name of the family. Helminthora
purpurea and divaricata with Nemaleon multifidum
and Scinaia furcellata represent them in Britain. They are
nearly all very rare, pretty plants, and very effective as microscopic
objects.</p>

<p>The Squamari&aelig;, formerly included in the Corallinace&aelig;, are a
small group of inconspicuous plants resembling lichens, of a
leathery texture, and growing on rocks and shells attached by
their lower surface.</p>

<p>A single genus only, Polyides, represents the Spongiocarpe&aelig;.
Polyides rotundus resembles Furcellaria fastigiata very closely,
but differs widely in the fruit, which consists of spongy warts
surrounding the frond, composed of spores and articulated
threads.</p>

<p>Of the next group represented in Britain, Gelidiace&aelig;, we
have only one plant, Gelidium corneum, very common on our
shores, and perhaps the most variable of all vegetable species.</p>

<p>The Sph&aelig;rococcid&aelig; include both membranaceous and cartilaginous
species. Of the latter is Sph&aelig;rococcus coronopifolius,
which cannot easily be mistaken, owing to the numerous berry-like
fruits that tip its branchlets. It is rather rare on the
northern, but often thrown ashore in large quantities on the
southern coasts. The genus Delesseria has four British species,
the largest being the well-known D. sinuosa, the fronds of
which resemble an oak leaf in outline. The handsomest are
D. ruscifolia and D. hypoglossum, which are more delicate and
of a finer colour than sinuosa. There are three British species
of Gracillaria, in two of which the branches are cylindrical, and
in the other flat. G. compressa makes an excellent preserve
and pickle, but unfortunately it is the rarest of the three.
Nitophyllum is one of the greatest ornaments of this tribe.
There are six British species, which are amongst the most delicate
and beautiful of our native Alg&aelig;.</p>

<p>The Corallinace&aelig; are remarkable for the property they
possess of absorbing carbonate of lime into their tissues, so that
they appear as a succession of chalky articulations or incrustations.
The most common is Corallina officinalis. There are
two British species of Corallina, and two also of the nearly
allied genus, Jania. Of the foliaceous group there are likewise
two British genera, Melobesia and Hildenbrantia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span></p>

<p>The next group, the Laurenciace&aelig;, are cartilaginous and cylindrical
or compressed, the frond in the greater portion of them
being inarticulate and solid. They contain several species valued
by collectors, although some of them are amongst our commonest
plants. Their colour is, when perfect, a dull purple or
brownish red, but they change under the influence of light and
air, while fresh water is rapidly destructive to their tints. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_10">Fig. 10.</a>)</span></p>

<p>The Chylocladi&aelig; are curiously jointed plants, removed by
Agardh to a new genus, Lomentaria, and a new order Chondri&aelig;.
Bonnemaisonia asparagoides is the most rare and beautiful of
the tribe.</p>

<p>The last tribe of red weeds, Rhodomelace&aelig;, varies greatly in
the structure of the frond, but the fruit is more uniform. Polysiphonia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
and Dasya contain the finest of the filiform division;
the leafy one, Odonthalia, a northern form, is a very beautiful
sea-weed both as respects form and colour. Well-grown specimens
are not unlike a hawthorn twig, and of a blood red colour.</p>

<p>The plants of the sub-order Melanosperme&aelig;, are, like the red
sea-weeds, exclusively marine. They are usually large and
coarse, and confined mostly to comparatively shallow water. In
the Laminariace&aelig; we find the gigantic oarweeds already briefly
referred to. Lessonia, which encircles in submarine forests the
antarctic coasts, is an erect, tree-like plant, with a trunk from
five to ten feet high, forked branches, and drooping leaves, one
to three feet in length, and has been compared to a weeping
willow. Sir Joseph Hooker says, that from a boat there may
on a calm day be witnessed in the antarctic regions, over these
submarine groves, "as busy a scene as is presented by the coral
reefs of the tropics. The leaves of the Lessoni&aelig; are crowded
with Sertulari&aelig; and Mollusca, or encircled with Flustra; on the
trunks parasitic Alg&aelig; abound, together with chitons, limpets,
and other shells; at the base and among the tangled roots
swarm thousands of Crustace&aelig; and Radiata, while fish of
several species dart among the leaves and branches." Of these
and other gigantic melanosperms, flung ashore by the waves, a
belt of decaying vegetable matter is formed, miles in extent,
some yards broad, and three feet in depth; and Sir J. Hooker
adds that the trunks of Lessonia so much resemble driftwood
that no persuasion could prevent an ignorant shipmaster from
employing his crew, during two bitterly cold days, in collecting
this incombustible material for fuel. Macrocystis and Nereocystis
are also giant members of this sub-order. Some of the
Laminari&aelig; which form a belt around our own coasts not seldom
attain a length of from eight to twelve feet. The common
bladder-wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) sometimes grows in Jutland
to a height of ten feet, and in clusters several feet in diameter.
The colour of most of the plants in this sub-order is
some shade of olive, but several of them turn to green in
drying.</p>

<p>The first group, Ectocarpe&aelig;, is composed of thread-like
jointed plants, the fructification of which consists of external
spores, sometimes formed by the swelling of a branchlet. The
typical genus, Ectocarpus, abounds in species, a dozen or so of
which, very nearly allied plants, being found around our own
shores. One or two of them are very handsome. There
are also some very beautiful plants in the genus Sphacelaria,
belonging to this group, several of them resembling miniature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
ferns. All the Sphacelari&aelig; are easily recognized by the
withered appearance of the tips of the fruiting branches. Myriotrichia
is a genus of small parasitical plants, the two British
species of which grow chiefly on the sea thongs (Chorda).</p>

<p>The Chordari&aelig; are sometimes gelatinous in structure, in other
cases cartilaginous. The fruit is contained in the substance of
the frond. The genus Chordaria consists of plants which
have the appearance of dark coloured twine. There are two
British species, one being rather common. Chorda filum, sea-rope,
another string-like sea-weed, grows in tufts from a few
inches to many feet in length, and tapering at the roots to about
the thickness of a pig's bristle. In quiet land-locked bays with
a sandy or muddy bottom, it sometimes extends to forty feet in
length, forming extensive meadows, obstructing the passage of
boats, and endangering the lives of swimmers entangled in its
slimy cords, whence probably its other name of "dead men's
lines."</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 11. Padina pavonia.</span>
</div>

<p>The Mesogloie&aelig; in a fresh state resemble bundles of green,
slimy worms. There are three British species, two of which
are not uncommon. Although so unattractive in external aspect,
they, like many others of the same description, prove very
interesting under the microscope. One of the cartilaginous
species, Leathsia tuberiformis, has the appearance, when growing,
of a mass of distorted tubers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span></p>

<p>The species of Elachista, composed of minute parasites, are,
as well as unattractive like the Mesogloie&aelig;, inconspicuous, but
are beautiful objects when placed under the microscope. Myrionem&aelig;
are also parasitic, and even smaller than the plants of
the preceding genus.</p>

<p>In the Dictyote&aelig; the frond is mostly flat, with a reticulated
surface, which is sprinkled when in fruit with groups of naked
spores or spore cysts. This tribe includes not a few of the most
elegant among the Alg&aelig;. In structure they are coriaceous, and
include plants both with broad and narrow, branched and unbranched
fronds. In Haliseris there is a distinct midrib. The
largest of the British Dictyote&aelig; is Cutleria multifida, sometimes
found a foot and a half long; and the best known is doubtless
Padina pavonia, much sought after by seaside visitors where it
grows. Its segments are fan-shaped, variegated with lighter
curved lines, and fringed with golden tinted filaments. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_11">Fig. 11.</a>)</span>
Owing to its power of decomposing light, its fronds, when growing
under water, suggest the train of the peacock, whence its specific
name. Taonia atomaria somewhat resembles Cutleria, but exhibits
also the wavy lines of Padina. The plant of this group most
often cast ashore is Dictyota dichotoma. It makes a handsome
specimen when well dried, and is interesting on account of the
manner in which it varies in the breadth of its divisions. The
variety intricata is curiously curled and entangled. Dictyosiphon
f&#339;niculaceus, the solitary British example of its genus, is a bushy
filiform plant, remarkable for the beautiful net-like markings of
its surface. The Punctari&aelig; have flattened fronds, marked with
dots, which sufficiently distinguish them from all the others. A
small form is often found parasitic on Chorda filum, spreading
out horizontally like the hairs of a bottle brush. Asperococcus
derives its name from its roughened surface, occasioned by
the thickly scattered spots of fructification.</p>

<p>The Laminariace&aelig; are inarticulate, mostly flat, often strap-shaped.
Their spores occur in superficial patches, or covering
the whole frond. The plants of this order, as we have already
seen, include the giants of submarine vegetation. In point of
mass they constitute the larger part of our native Alg&aelig;, although
they number only a few species. They are popularly known as
tangle or oarweeds, and the stems of Laminaria saccharina and
the midrib of Alaria esculenta are used as food.</p>

<p>The Sporochnace&aelig; are a small but beautiful tribe, inarticulate,
and producing their spores in jointed filaments or knob-like
masses, and remarkable for their property of turning from olive
brown to a verdigris green when exposed to the atmosphere.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 12. Fucus serratus, showing a transverse section of the Conceptacle, and Antheridium with Antherozoids escaping.</span>
</div>

<p>They are deep sea plants, or at least grow about low water
mark. The largest of the group is Desmarestia ligulata,
which, with the other British species, D. aculeata, is often cast
ashore. The latter species, at an early period of its existence, is
clothed with tufts of slender hairs, springing from the margin of
the frond. Desmarestia viridis is the most delicate and also the
rarest of the three. Nothing like fruit has been discovered on
any of them. Arthocladia villosa and Sporochnus pedunculatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
are branched sea-weeds, covered also with tufts of closely set
hairs. Carpomitra Cabrer&aelig;, a rare species, bears, in common
with the two preceding species, its spores in a special receptacle.
In the first the receptacle is pod-like; in the second knotted;
and in the last mitriform.</p>

<p>The concluding group of Alg&aelig; is the Fucace&aelig;, including the
universally known sea wrack (Fucus). The frond in all of them
is jointless. They are reproduced by means of antheridia and
oogonia developed in conceptacles, clustered together at the
apex of the branches. Both from their bulk and their decided
sexual distinctions, they deserve to rank at the head of the
order. Of all sea-weeds they are also perhaps of the
greatest use to man. One of the most interesting among
them is the Gulfweed (Sargassum bacciferum), occupying a
tract of the Atlantic extending over many degrees of latitude.
Pieces of it, and of its congener, S. vulgare, are occasionally
drifted to our shores, and they consequently find a place in works
on British Alg&aelig;, although they have no claim to be considered
native plants. On rocky coasts the various species of Fucus
occupy the greater part of the space between tide-marks, the
most plentiful being Fucus vesiculosus. F. serratus <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>)</span>
is the handsomest of the genus, the other species being F.
nodosus, said to be the most useful for making kelp, and
F. canaliculatus. Halidrys siliquosa is remarkable for its spore
receptacles, which have quite the appearance of the seed vessel
of a flowering plant. The species of Cystoseira, chiefly confined
to the southern coasts, are also very interesting. Their
submerged fronds are beautifully iridescent, and the stems, of the
largest species at least, are generally covered with a great variety
of parasites, animal and vegetable, the former consisting of
Hydrozoa and Polyzoa, and other curious forms. Himanthalia
lorea is another remarkable plant. It has conspicuous forked
fruit-bearing receptacles; but the real plants are the small
cones at the base of these, and from which they are shed when
ripe.</p>

<p>As to conditions of site and geographical distribution, Alg&aelig; do
not differ from land plants. Latitude, depth of water, and
currents influence them in the same way as latitude, elevation,
and station operate on the latter; and the analogy is maintained
in the almost cosmopolitan range of some, and the restricted
habitat of others. Not many extra-European species of Desmids
are known, but those of Diatoms are far more widely diffused, and
extend beyond the limits of all other vegetation, existing wherever
there is water sufficient to allow of their production; and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
are found not only in water, but also on the moist surface of the
ground and on other plants, in hot springs and amid polar ice.
They are said to occur in such countless myriads in the South
Polar Sea as to stain the berg and pack ice wherever these are
washed by the surge. A deposit of mud, chiefly consisting of
the shells of Diatoms, 400 miles long, 120 miles broad, and of
unknown thickness, was found at a depth of between 200 and 400
feet on the flanks of Victoria Land in 70° south latitude. Such
is their abundance in some rivers and estuaries that Professor
Ehrenberg goes the length of affirming that they have exercised
an important influence in blocking up harbours and diminishing
the depth of channels. The trade and other winds distribute large
quantities over the earth, which may account for the universality
of their specific distribution; for Sir Joseph Hooker found the
Himalayan species to closely resemble our own. Common British
species also occur in Ceylon, Italy, Virginia, and Peru. The
typical species of the Confervace&aelig; are also distributed over the
whole surface of the globe. They inhabit both fresh and salt
water, and are found alike in the polar seas and in the boiling
springs of Iceland, in mineral waters and in chemical solutions.
Some of the tropical ones are exceedingly large and dense.
Batrachospermum vagum, in the next tribe, a native of England,
is also found in New Zealand. An edible species of Nostochine&aelig;,
produced on the boggy slopes bordering the Arctic Ocean, is
blown about by the winds sometimes ten miles from land, where
it is found lying in small depressions in the snow upon the ice.
The common Nostoc of moist ground in England occurs also in
Kerguelen's Land, high in the southern hemisphere. Floating
masses of Monormia are often the cause of the green hue assumed
by the water of ponds and lakes. Certain species of Oscillatoria
of a deep red colour live in hot springs in India, and the Red
Sea is supposed to have derived its name from a species of this
tribe, which covers it with a scum for many miles, according to
the direction of the wind. The lake of Glaslough in County
Monaghan, Ireland, owes its colour and its name to Oscillatoria
&aelig;rugescens, and large masses of water in Scotland and
Switzerland are tinted green or purple by a similar agency.
A few species of Siphone&aelig; have a very wide range, two British
species of Codium occurring in New Zealand. The Ulvace&aelig;
abound principally in the colder latitudes. Enteromorpha intestinalis,
a common British species, is as frequent in Japan, where
it is used, when dried, in soup. The Rhodosperms are found in
every sea, although the geographical boundaries of genera are
often well-marked. Gloiosiphonia, one of our rarest and most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
beautiful Alg&aelig;, is widely diffused. Of Melanosperms the
Laminari&aelig; affect the higher northern latitudes, Sargassa abound
in the warmer seas, while Durvill&aelig;a, Lessonia, and Macrocystis
characterize the marine flora of the Southern Ocean. The
Fucace&aelig; are most abundant towards the poles, where they
attain their greatest size. The marine meadows of Sargassum,
conceived by some naturalists to mark the site of the lost
Atlantis, and which give its name to the Sargasso Sea, extending
between 20° and 25° north latitude, in 40° west longitude,
occupy now the same position as when the early navigators,
with considerable trepidation, forced through their masses on
the way to the New World. Sargassum is drifted into this tract
of ocean by currents, the plants being all detached; and they do
not produce fruit in that state, being propagated by buds, which
originate new branches and leaves. <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_1_Fig_12">Fig. 13.</a>)</span></p>

<p>Owing to their soft, cellular structure, Alg&aelig; are not likely to
be preserved in a fossil state; but what have been considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
such have been found as low down as the Silurian formation,
although their identity has been disputed, and several of them,
it is more than probable, belong to other orders, and some even
to the animal kingdom. Freshwater forms, all of existing genera
and species, are believed to have been detected in the carboniferous
rocks of Britain and France; others also of the green-coloured
division are said to occur from the Silurian to the
Eocene, and the Floride&aelig; to be represented from the Lias to the
Miocene. The indestructible nature of the shells of the Diatomace&aelig;
has enabled them to survive where the less protected
species may have perished. Tripoli stone, a Tertiary rock, is
entirely composed of the remains of microscopic plants of this
tribe. It is from their silicious shells that mineral acquires its use
in the arts, as powder for polishing stones and metals. Ehrenberg
estimates that in every cubic inch of the tripoli of Bilin, in
Bohemia, there are 41,000,000 of Gaillonella distans. Districts
recovered from the sea frequently contain myriads of Diatoms,
forming strata of considerable thickness; and similar deposits
occur in the ancient sites of lakes in this and other countries.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Before setting out in search of Alg&aelig; the collector ought to
provide himself with a pair of stout boots to guard his feet from
the sharp-pointed rocks, as well as a staff or pole to balance
himself in rock-climbing, which ought to have a hook for drawing
floating weed ashore. A stout table-knife tied to the other
end will be found very useful. A basket&mdash;a fishing-basket does
very well&mdash;or a waterproof bag, for stowing away his plants, is
also necessary. It is advisable to carry a few bottles for the
very small and delicate plants, and care should be taken to keep
apart, and in sea-water, any specimens of the Sporochnace&aelig;; for
they are not only apt to decay themselves but to become a cause
of corruption in the other weeds with which they come in contact.
These bottles should always be carried in the bag or pocket,
never in the hand.</p>

<p>Sea-weeds, as every visitor to the coast knows, are torn up
in great numbers by the waves, especially during storms, and
afterwards left on the shore by the retiring tide. Many shallow-growing
species are also to be found attached to the rocks,
and in the rock pools, between high and low water mark.
There are three points on the beach where the greatest accumulations
of floating Alg&aelig; are found: high water mark, mid-tide
level, and low water mark. Low water occurs about five or
five and a half hours after high water. The best time for the
collector to commence is half an hour or so before dead low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
water. He can then work to the lowest point safely, and, retiring
before the approaching tide, examine the higher part of
the beach up to high water mark. If the coarse weeds in the
rock pools and chinks are turned back, many rare and delicate
Alg&aelig; will be found growing under them, especially at the lowest
level. The most effective method of collecting the plants of
deeper water is by dredging, or going round with a boat at the
extreme ebb, and taking them from the rocks and from the
Laminaria stems, on which a great number have their station.
Stems of Laminaria thrown out by the waves should also be
carefully examined. In all cases the weed should be well rinsed
in a clear rock pool before being put away in the bag or other
receptacle.</p>

<p>The next thing to be considered is the laying out and preserving
of the specimens selected for the herbarium. Wherever
possible these should be laid out on paper, and put under pressure
as soon as gathered, or on the same day at all events.
When this is impracticable, they may be spread between the
folds of soft and thick towels and rolled up. Thus treated the
most delicate plants will keep fresh until next day. Another
way is to pack the plants in layers of salt, like herrings; but
the most usual method of roughly preserving sea-weeds collected
during an unprepared visit to the shore is by moderately drying
them in an airy room out of the direct rays of the sun. They
are then to be placed lightly in bags, and afterwards relaxed by
immersion and prepared in the usual way. The finer plants,
however, suffer more or less by this delay. If carried directly
home from the sea the plants should be emptied into a vessel of
sea-water. A flat dish, about fourteen inches square and three
deep, is then to be filled with clean water. For most plants
this may be fresh, for some it is essential that it should be salt.
Some of the Polysiphonias and others begin to decompose at
once if placed in fresh water. The Griffithsias burst and let
out their colouring matter, and a good many change their colour.
The appliances required are some fine white paper&mdash;good printing
demy, thirty-six pounds or so in weight per ream, does very
well,&mdash;an ample supply of smooth blotting paper, the coarse
paper used by grocers and called "sugar royal," or, best of
all, Bentall's botanical drying paper, pieces of well-washed
book muslin, a camel's hair brush, a bodkin for assisting
to spread out the plants, a pair of scissors, and a pair of
forceps. The mounting paper may be cut in three sizes:
5 in. by 4 in., 7&frac12; in. by 5&frac14; in., and 10 in. by 7&frac12; in. Then
having selected a specimen, place it in the flat dish referred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
to above, and prune it <ins title='Correction - was "it"'>if</ins> necessary. Next take a piece of
the mounting paper of suitable size, and slip it into the water
underneath the plant, keeping hold of it with the thumb of
the left hand. Having arranged the plant in a natural manner
on the paper, brush it gently with the camel's hair <ins title='Correction - was "pencile"'>brush</ins>, to
remove any dirt or fragments, draw out paper and plant gently
and carefully in an oblique direction, and set them on end for a
short time to drain. Having in this way transferred as many
specimens as will cover a sheet of drying paper, lay them upon
it neatly side by side, and cover them with a piece of old muslin.
Four sheets of drying paper are then to be placed upon this,
then another layer of plants and muslin and four more sheets of
drying paper, until a heap, it may be six or eight inches thick,
is built up. Place this between two flat boards, weighted with
stones, bricks, or other weights; but the pressure should be
moderate at first, otherwise the texture of the muslin may be
stamped on both paper and plant. The papers must be changed
in about three hours' time, and afterwards every twelve hours.
In three or four days, according to the state of the weather, the
muslin may be removed, the plants again transferred to dry
paper, and subjected to rather severe pressure for several
days.</p>

<p>The very gelatinous plants require particular treatment. One
way is to put them in drying paper and under a board but to
apply no other pressure, change the drying paper at least twice
during the first half hour, and after the second change of dryers
apply very gentle pressure, increasing it until the specimens
are fully dry. A safer and less troublesome way, for the efficacy
of which we can vouch, is to lay down the plants and dry
them without any pressure, afterwards damping the back of the
mounting papers and placing them in the drying press. Some
Alg&aelig; will scarcely adhere to paper. These should be pressed
until tolerably dry, then be immersed in skim-milk for a quarter
of an hour, and pressed and dried as before. A slight application
of isinglass, dissolved in alcohol, to the under side of the
specimen is sometimes necessary. Before mounting, or at all
events before transference to the herbarium, care should be
taken to write in pencil on the back of the paper the name of
the plant, if known, the place where gathered, and the date.
The coarse olive weeds, such as the bladder-wrack, Halidrys,
and the like, may in the case of a short visit to the coast be
allowed to dry in an airy place, and taken home in the rough.
Before pressing, in any case, they should be steeped in boiling
water for about half an hour to extract the salt, then washed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
clean fresh water, dried between coarse towels, and pressed and
dried in the same way as flowering plants. A collection of
Alg&aelig; may be fastened on sheets of paper of the usual herbarium
size and kept in a cabinet or portfolios, or attached to the
leaves of an album. For scientific purposes, however, the latter
is the least convenient way.</p>

<p>There are few objects more beautiful than many of the
sea-weeds when well preserved; but the filiform species,
especially those of the first sub-order, do not retain their
distinguishing characters when pressed as has been described.
Portions of these, however, as well as sections of stems and
fruit, may be usefully dried on small squares of thin mica,
for subsequent microscopic examination, or they may be
mounted on the ordinary microscope slides. This is the
only course possible with Desmids and Diatoms. The former
are to be sought in shallow pools, especially in open boggy
moors. The larger species commonly lie in a thin gelatinous
stratum at the bottom of the pools, and by gently passing the
fingers under them they will be caused to rise towards the surface,
when they can be lifted with a scoop. Other species form
a greenish or dirty cloud on the stems and leaves of other
aquatic plants, and by stripping the plant between the fingers
these also may be similarly detached and secured. If they are
much diffused through the water, they may be separated by
straining through linen; and this is a very common way of procuring
them. Living Diatoms are found on aquatic plants, on
rocks and stones, under water or on mud, presenting themselves
as coloured fringes, cushion-like tufts, or filmy strata. In colour
the masses vary from a yellowish brown to almost black. They
are difficult, both when living and dead, to separate from foreign
matter; but repeated washings are effectual in both cases, and,
for the living ones, their tendency to move towards the light may
also be taken advantage of. When only the shells are wanted
for mounting, the cell contents are removed by means of hydrochloric
and nitric acid. The most satisfactory medium for preserving
fresh Desmids and Diatoms is distilled water, and if the
water is saturated with camphor, or has dissolved in it a grain
of alum and a grain of bay salt to an ounce of water, confervoid
growths will be prevented. For larger preparations of Alg&aelig;,
Thwaites' fluid is strongly recommended. This is made by
adding to one part of rectified spirit as many drops of creasote
as will saturate it, and then gradually mixing with it in a pestle
and mortar some prepared chalk, with sixteen parts of water;
an equal quantity of water saturated with camphor is then to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
added, and the mixture, after standing for a few days, to be
carefully filtered.</p>

<p>For authorities on the morphology and classification of the
Alg&aelig;, students may be referred to Sachs' "Text Book" and
Le Maout's "System of Botany," of which there are good translations,
and the "Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany," by the
Rev. M. J. Berkeley; for descriptions and the identification
of species, to the text and figures of Harvey's "Phycologia
Britannica," and "Nature-Printed Sea-weeds." Both of these
are however costly. Among the cheaper works are "British
Sea-weeds," by S. O. Gray (Lovell, Reeve &amp; Co.), "Harvey's
Manual" and an abridgment by Mrs. A. Gatty, with reduced
but well executed copies of the figures, of the Phycologia. This
synopsis can often be picked up cheap at second-hand bookstalls;
and there is a very excellent low-priced work suitable for
amateurs, Grattann's "British Marine Alg&aelig;," containing recognizable
figures of nearly all our native species. Landsborough's
"Popular History of British Sea-weeds," and Mrs.
Lane Clarke's "Common Sea-weeds," are also cheap and useful
manuals on the subject.</p>

<p>In the very earliest times, long before there was any attempt
at the scientific classification and arrangement of shells, they
appear to have been objects of admiration, and to have been
valued on account of their beauty, for we find that the pre-historic
men, who, in company with the mammoth, or hairy
elephant, and other animals now extinct, inhabited Southern
France in days long gone by, used to bore holes in them, and,
like the savage of to-day, wear them as ornaments. The Greek
physician and philosopher, Aristotle, is said to have been the
first to study the formation of shells, and to raise the knowledge
thus acquired into the position of a science; by him shells were
divided into three orders&mdash;an arrangement preserved, with some
small changes, by Linn&aelig;us. It is possible that the world-wide
renown of the Swedish naturalist during the last century, and
the ardour with which he pursued his investigations, may have
given an impetus to the study of natural objects, for we find that
at that period large sums were often given by collectors for
choice specimens of shells. Nor is this to be wondered at, for
few things look nicer, or better repay trouble expended on them,
than does a well-arranged and carefully mounted and named
collection of shells. Certainly nothing looks worse than a
number of shells of all descriptions, of every kind, shape, and
colour, thrown promiscuously into a box, like the unfortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
animals in a toy Noah's ark, to the great detriment of their value
and beauty; for, as the inevitable result of shaking against each
other, the natural polish is taken off some, the delicate points
and ornaments are broken off others, the whole collection becoming
in time unsightly and disappointing, and all for want of
a little care at the outset.</p>

<p>In this, as in every other undertaking, "how to set about it"
is the chief difficulty with beginners; and here, perhaps, a few
hints gathered from experience may not be without value. One
thing a young collector should always bear in mind, however,
is, that no instructions can be of any avail to him uhis
part, he is prepared to bring patience, neatness, and attention to
detail, to bear upon his work.</p>

<p>Since it is important to know the best way of storing specimens
already acquired, we will, in the first place, devote a few words
to this point, and then proceed to describe the best means of
collecting specimens, and of naming, mounting, and arranging
the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="MAKE_A_CABINET" id="MAKE_A_CABINET"></a>
<div class="caption2">HOW TO MAKE A CABINET.</div>


<p>It is a common mistake, both with old and young, to imagine
that a handsome cabinet is, in the first instance, a necessity; but
no greater blunder can be made: the cabinet should be considered
merely an accessory, the collection itself being just as
valuable, and generally more useful, when kept in a series of plain
wooden or cardboard boxes. We intend, therefore, to describe
the simplest possible means of keeping a collection of shells,
leaving elaborate and costly methods to those who value the
case more than its contents.</p>

<p>The first thing required is some method of keeping the different
species of shells apart, so that they may not get mixed, or
be difficult to find when wanted. The simplest plan of doing
this is to collect all the empty chip match-boxes you can find,
throw away the cases in which they slide, and keep the trays,
trying to get as many of a size as possible. (The ordinary
Bryant &amp; May's, or Bell &amp; Black's, are the most useful, and
with them the trays of the small Swedish match-boxes, two of
which, placed side by side, occupy nearly exactly the same space
as one and a half of the larger size, and so fit in with them
nicely.) In these trays your shells should be placed, one kind
in each tray; but although very convenient for most specimens,
they will of course be too small for very many, and so the larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
trays must be made. This may easily be done as follows: cut
a rectangular piece of cardboard two inches longer one way than
the length of the match-tray, and two inches more the other way
<a name="Sect_2_Fig_1"></a>
<span class="figleft" style="width:150px">
<img src="images/pg_37.png" width="144" height="174" alt="Fig. 1. How to cut a cardboard tray." title="Fig. 1. How to cut a cardboard tray." /><br />
<span class="caption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 1. How to cut<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cardboard tray.</span>
</span>
than twice the width of the match-tray;
then with a pencil rule lines one inch from
the edges and parallel with them <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>);</span>
next cut out the little squares <span class="nowrap">(<i>a a</i>,</span> <span class="nowrap"><i>a a</i>)</span>
these lines form in the corners of the piece
of cardboard, and then with a penknife
cut <i>half</i> through the card, exactly on the
remaining pencil-lines, and bend up the
pieces, which will then form sides for your
tray; and by binding it round with a piece
of blue paper, you will have one that will
look neat, uniform with the others, and
yet be just twice their size. If required,
you can make in the same way any size, only take care that they
are all multiples of one standard size, as loss of space will
thereby be avoided when you come to the next process in your
cabinet. This is, to get a large box or tray in which to hold
your smaller ones.</p>


<p>The simplest plan is to get some half-dozen cardboard boxes
(such as may be obtained for the asking or for a very trifling cost
at any draper's), having a depth of from one to two inches (according
to the size of your shells); in these your trays may be
arranged in columns, and the boxes can be kept one above the
other in a cupboard or in a larger box. More boxes and trays
can, from time to time, be added as occasion requires, and thus
the whole collection may be kept in good working order at a
trifling cost. A more durable form of cheap cabinet may be
made by collecting the wooden boxes so common in grocers'
shops, cleaning them with sand-paper, staining and varnishing
them outside, and lining them inside with paper; or, if handy
at carpentering, you may make all your boxes, or even a real
cabinet, for yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="COLLECT_SHELLS" id="COLLECT_SHELLS"></a>
<div class="caption2">HOW TO COLLECT SHELLS.</div>

<p>Provision being thus made for the comfortable accommodation
of your treasures, the next consideration is, how to set about collecting
them. Mollusca are to be found all over the globe, from
the frozen north to the sun-baked tropics, on the land or in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
lakes, rivers, or seas&mdash;wherever, in fact, they can find the food
and other conditions suitable for their growth and development;
but the collector who is not also a great traveller, must of course
rely for his foreign specimens upon the generosity of friends, or
else procure them from dealers. In most districts of our own
country, there are, however, to be found large numbers of shells
whose variety and beauty will astonish and reward the efforts of
any patient seeker. Begin with your own garden,&mdash;search in the
out-of-the-way, and especially damp, corners; turn over the
flower-pots and stones which have lain longest in one place,
search amongst the roots of the grass growing under walls, and
in the moss round the roots of the trees, and you will be surprised
at the number of different shells you may find in a very
short space of time. When the resources of the garden have
been exhausted, go into the nearest lanes and again search the
grass and at the roots of plants, especially the nettles which grow
beside ditches and in damp places; hunt amongst the dead leaves
in plantations, and literally leave no stone unturned. All the
apparatus it is necessary to take on these excursions consists of
a few small match or pill-boxes in which to carry home the
specimens; a pair of forceps to pick up the smaller ones, or to
get them out of cracks; a hooked stick to beat down and pull
away the nettles; and, above all, sharp eyes trained to powers of
observation. The best time to go out, is just after a warm
shower, when all the grass and leaves are still wet, for the land-snails
are very fond of moisture, and the shower entices them out
of their lurking-places. Where the ground is made of chalk or
limestone, they will be found most abundant; for as the snail's
shell is composed of layers of animal tissue, strengthened by
depositions of calcareous earthy-matter which the creature gets
from the plants on which it feeds, and these in their turn obtain
from the soil&mdash;it naturally follows that the snail prefers to dwell
where that article is most abundant, as an hour's hunt on any
chalk-down will soon show.</p>

<p>When garden and lanes are both exhausted, you may then turn
to the ponds and streams in the neighbourhood, where you will
find several new kinds. Some will be crawling up the rushes
near the margin of the water, others will be found in the water
near the bank, while others may be obtained by pulling on shore
pieces of wood and branches that may be floating in the water;
but the best are sure to be beyond the reach of arm or stick, and
it will be necessary to employ a net, which may be easily made
by bending a piece of wire into a circle of about four inches in
diameter, and sewing to it a small gauze bag; it may be mounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
either on a long bamboo, or, better still, on one of those ingenious
Japanese walking-stick fishing-rods. For heavier work, however,
such as getting fresh-water mussels and other mollusca from
the bottom, you will require a net something like the accompanying
figure <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>)</span>, about one foot in diameter. This,
when attached to a long rope, may be thrown out some distance
and dragged through the water-weeds to the shore, or if made
with a square instead of a circular mouth, it may be so weighted
that it will sink to the bottom, and be used as a dredge for catching
the mussels which live half-buried in the mud. To carry the
water-snails home, you will find it necessary to have tin boxes
(empty mustard-tins are the best), as match-boxes come to pieces
when wetted.</p>

<a name="Sect_2_Fig_2"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/pg_39.png" width="523" height="140" alt="Fig. 2. Net for taking water-snails." title="Fig. 2. Net for taking water-snails." /><br />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2. Net for taking water-snails.</span>
</div>

<p>The finest collections of shells, however, are to be made at the
sea-side, for the marine mollusca are both more varied in kind and
more abundant than the land and fresh-water ones, and quite an
extensive collection may be made in the course of an afternoon's
ramble along the shore; it is necessary, however, to carefully
reject such specimens as are worn by having been rolled by the
waves upon the beach, as they are not of any great value in a
collection; it is better, in fact, if possible, to go down to the
rocks at low water and collect the living specimens. Search well
about and under the sea-weeds, and in the rock-pools, and, when
boating, throw your dredge-net out and tow it behind, hauling it
in occasionally to see what you have caught, and to empty the
stones and rubbish out.</p>

<p>At low tide also, look out for rocks with a number of round
holes in them, all close together, for in these holes the Pholas
(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>) dwells, having bored a burrow in the solid rock,
though <i>how</i> he does it we do not yet quite know.</p>

<p>The Razor-shells and Cockles live in the sand, their presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
being indicated by a small round hole; but they bury themselves
so fast that you will find it difficult to get at them. Some good
specimens, too, of the deeper water forms are sure to be found
near the spots where fishermen drag their boats ashore, as they
are often thrown away in clearing out the nets; moreover, if
you can make friends with any of the said fishermen, they will
be able to find and bring you many nice specimens from time to
time.</p>

<p>The reason that so much has been said about collecting living
specimens, is not only because in them the shell is more likely
to be perfect, but also because in its living state the shell is
coated with a layer of animal matter, sometimes thin and transparent,
at others thick and opaque, called the <i>periostracum</i> (or
<i>epidermis</i>), which serves to protect the shell from the weather,
but which perishes with the animal, so that dead shells which
have lain for some time tenantless on the ground, or at the bottom
of the water, exposed to the destructive agencies that are constantly
at work in nature, have almost invariably lost both their
natural polish and their varied hues, and are besides only too
often broken as well. Since, however, even a damaged specimen
is better than none at all, such should always be kept until a
more perfect example can be obtained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="PREPARE_THE_SHELLS" id="PREPARE_THE_SHELLS"></a>
<div class="caption2">HOW TO PREPARE THE SHELLS FOR THE CABINET.</div>


<p>The question with which we have next to deal is, after collecting
a number of living mollusks, how, in the quickest and most painless
manner possible, to kill the animals in order to obtain possession
of their shells. There is but one way we know of in which
this may be accomplished, and that is by placing the creatures in
an earthen jar and pouring <i>boiling</i> water on them. With land,
or fresh-water snails, the addition of a large spoonful of table-salt
is advisable, as it acts upon them chemically, and not only puts
them sooner out of pain, but also renders their subsequent extraction
far easier. Death by this process is instantaneous, and consequently
painless; but to leave snails in cold salt water is to inflict
on them the tortures of a lingering death; while for the brutality
of gardeners and other thoughtless persons who seek to destroy
the poor snail they find eating their plants by crushing it under
foot on the gravel path, no words of condemnation are too strong,
since it must always be borne in mind that snails have not, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
us, <i>one</i> nervous centre, but three, and are far more tenacious of
life; hence, unless all the nerves are destroyed at once, a great
deal of suffering is entailed on the poor creature; and if merely
crushed under foot, the mangled portions <i>will live for hours</i>.
Hot water has also the advantage of tending to remove the dirt
which is almost sure to have gathered on the shells, and so
helping to prepare them better for the cabinet. As soon as the
water is cool enough, fish out the shells one by one and proceed
to extract the dead animals. This, if the mollusk is <i>univalve</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, whose shell is composed of a single piece), such as an
ordinary garden snail, can easily be done by picking them out
with a pin; you will find, probably, that some of the smaller
ones have shrunk back so far into their shells as to be beyond the
reach of a straight pin, so it will be necessary to bend the pin
with a pair of pliers, or, if none are at hand, a key will answer
the purpose if the pin be put into one of the notches and bent
over the edge until sufficiently curved to reach up the shell. You
will find it convenient to keep a set of pins bent to different
curves, to which you may fit handles by cutting off the heads and
sticking them into match stems. It is a good plan to soak some
of the smaller snails in clean cold water before killing them, as
they swell out with the water, and do not, when dead, retreat so far
into their shells. If you have a microscope, and wish to keep the
animals till you have time to get the tongues out, drop the bodies
into small bottles of methylated spirit and water, when they will
keep till required, otherwise they should of course be thrown
away at once. The now empty shells should be washed in clean
warm water, and, if very dirty, gently scrubbed with a soft nail or
tooth brush, and then carefully dried.</p>

<p>In such shells as the Periwinkle, Whelk, etc., whose inhabitants
close the entrance of their dwelling with a trap-door, or
<i>operculum</i> as it is called, you should be careful to preserve each
with its proper shell.</p>

<p>If you are cleaning <i>bivalves</i>, or shells composed of two pieces,
like the common mussel, you will have to remove the animal with
a penknife, and while leaving the inside quite clean, be very
careful not to break the ligament which serves as a hinge; then
wash as before, and tie them together to prevent their gaping
open when dry.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fresh-water or marine shells are so coated over
with a vegetable growth that no scrubbing with water alone will
remove it, and in these cases a weak solution of caustic soda may
be used, but very carefully, since, if too strong a solution be employed,
the surface of the shell will be removed with the dirt, and

the specimen spoilt. In some shells the
periostracum is very thick and coarse, and
must be removed before the shell itself can
be seen; but it is always well to keep at
least one specimen in its rough state as an
example. In other shells the periostracum
is covered over with very fine, delicate
hairs (<i>Helix sericea</i> and <i>Helix hispida</i>,
<span class="nowrap"><a href="#Sect_2_Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>)</span>, and great care must then be taken
not to brush these off.</p>

<a name="MOUNT_THE_SHELLS" id="MOUNT_THE_SHELLS"></a>
<div class="caption2">HOW TO MOUNT THE SHELLS FOR THE CABINET.</div>

<p>When the specimens are thoroughly cleaned, the next process
is to sort out the different kinds, placing each description in a
different tray, and then to get them ready for mounting, for no collection
will look well unless each kind is so arranged that it may be
seen to the best advantage, and is also carefully named. Where you
have a good number, pick out first the largest specimens of their
kind, then the smallest, then a series, as you have room for them,
of the most perfect; and finally those which show any peculiarity
of structure or marking. Try, too, to get young forms as well as
adult, for the young are often very different in appearance from
the full-grown shell. Mark on them, especially on such as you
have found yourself, the locality they came from, as it is very
important to the shell collector to know this, since specimens
common enough in one district are often rare in another. Either
write the name of the place in ink on a corner of the shell itself,
or gum a small label just inside it, or simply number it, and write
the name of the place with a corresponding number against it in
a book kept for the purpose. Next select a tray large enough to
hold all you have of this kind; place a piece of cotton wool at the
bottom, and lay your shells upon it. For small shells, however,
this method is not suitable, as the cotton wool acts on them like
a spring mattress, and they are liable on the least shock to be
jerked out of their trays and lost. This difficulty may be met by
cutting a piece of cardboard so that it just fits into your tray, and
then gumming the shells on to it in rows; but remember that, in
this plan of mounting, it is impossible to take the shells up and
examine them on all sides as you do the loose ones, and so you
must mount a good many, and place them in many different
positions, so that they may be seen from as many points of view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
as possible. The gum used should always have nearly one-sixth
of its bulk of pure glycerine added to it; this prevents it from
becoming brittle when dry, otherwise your specimens would be
liable after a time to break away from the card and get lost. If
the shells will not stay in the position you require, wedge them
up with little pieces of cork until the gum is dry.</p>

<p>When the shells are mounted, you must try, if you have not
already done so, to get the proper names for them; it is as
important to be able to call shells by their right names as it
is to know people by theirs. The commoner sorts you will be
able to name from the figures of them given in text-books,
such as those quoted in the list at the end of this little work; but
some you will find it very difficult to name, and it will then be
necessary to ask friends who have collections to help you, or to
take them to some museum and compare them with the named
specimens there exhibited. When the right name is discovered,
your label must then be written in a very small, neat hand, and
gummed to the edge of the tray or on the card if your specimens
are mounted. At the top you put the Latin name, ruling a line
underneath it, and then, if you like, add the English name; next,
put the name of the place and the date at which it was found,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="caption2">HOW TO CLASSIFY THE SHELLS FOR THE CABINET.</div>


<p>All the foregoing processes, except the naming of your specimens,
are more or less mechanical, and are only the means to the
end&mdash;a properly arranged collection. For, however well a collection
may be mounted, it is practically useless if the different shells
composing it be not properly classified. By classification is
meant the bringing together those kinds that most resemble each
other, first of all into large groups having special characteristics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
in common, and then by subdividing these into other smaller
groups, and so on. Thus the animal kingdom is divided, first of all,
into <i>Sub-kingdoms</i>, then each <i>Sub-kingdom</i> into so many <i>Classes</i>
containing those which have further characteristics in common,
the <i>Classes</i> into <i>Orders</i>, the <i>Orders</i> into <i>Families</i>, the <i>Families</i>
into <i>Genera</i>, and these again into species or kinds.</p>

<p>The Mollusca, or soft-bodied animals, of whose protecting shells
your collection consists, form a sub-kingdom, and are subdivided
into four classes:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li> Cephalopoda.</li>
<li> Gasteropoda.</li>
<li> Pteropoda.</li>
<li> Lamellibranchiata (or Conchifera).</li>
</ol>

<p>And these again into Families, Genera, and Species.</p>

<p>The space at our disposal being limited, it is impossible to do
more than furnish some general outlines of the different forms.
For further details it will be necessary to refer to one of the
larger works, a list of which will be found on the last page.</p>

<p>CLASS I.&mdash;The CEPHALOPODA (Head-footed) contains those mollusca that,
like the common Octopus, have a number of feet (or arms) set round the mouth, and
is divided into those having two gills. (Order I. Dibranchiata); and those with
four (Order II. Tetrabranchiata). Order I. is again divided into: (<i>a.</i>) Those with <i>eight</i>
feet like the Argonaut (or Paper-nautilus, <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Sect_2_Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>),</span> which fable has so long endowed with the
power of sailing on the surface of the ocean, (it is
even represented in one book as propelling itself through the
air!) and the common Octopus. (<i>b.</i>) Those with <i>ten</i> feet, such as
the Loligo (or Squid, <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Sect_2_Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>),</span> whose delicate internal shell so
much resembles a pen in shape; the Cuttle-fish (Sepia, <span class="nowrap">Figs. <a href="#Sect_2_Fig_5">5</a> &amp; <a href="#Sect_2_Fig_2">7</a>),</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>

frequently found on our southern coasts; and the pretty little
<i>Spirula</i> <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The only representative of the four-gilled order now living
is the well-known Pearly Nautilus; but in former times the
Tetrabranchiata were extremely numerous, especially the <i>Ammonites</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLASS II.&mdash;GASTEROPODA (Belly-footed) comprises those
mollusca which, like the common snail, creep
on the under-surface of the body, and with one
exception (<i>Chiton</i>, <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Sect_2_Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>)</span> their shells are univalve
(<i>i.e.</i>, composed of one piece). But before
we go further, it may be well to point out the
names given to different parts of a univalve shell.
The aperture whence the animal issues is called
the <i>mouth</i>, and its outer edge the <i>lip</i>; each turn
of the shell is a <i>whorl</i>; the last and biggest, the
<i>body-whorl</i>, the whorls, from the point at the
top, or <i>apex</i>, down to the mouth form the <i>spire</i>; and the line
where the whorls join each other is called the <i>suture</i>. The axis
of the shell around which the whorls are coiled is sometimes
open or hollow, and the shell is then said to be <i>umbilicated</i> (as
in Fig. 3<i>b</i>); when closely coiled, a pillar of shell, or <i>columella</i>, is
left (as in <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Sect_2_Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>).</span> Sometimes the corner of the mouth farthest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
from the spire and next the columella, is produced into a channel,
the <i>anterior canal</i> (as in <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Sect_2_Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>);</span> whilst where the mouth
meets the base of the spire there may be a kind of notch which
is termed the <i>posterior canal</i>. Most Gasteropods are <i>dextral</i>,
that is to say, the mouth is to the right of the axis as you look at
it; a few, however, are <i>sinistral</i>, or wound to the left (like <i>Physa</i>);
whilst reversed varieties of both kinds are met with.</p>

<p>Gasteropods of the first order have comb-like gills placed in
advance of the heart, and are hence termed <span class="smcap">Prosobranchiata</span>.
They are divided into two groups: (<i>a</i>) <i>Siphonostomata</i> (Tube-mouthed),
in which the animal has a long proboscis, and a tube,
or siphon, from the breathing-chamber that passes along the
anterior canal of the shell, which in this group is well developed.
They have a horny operculum, or lid, with which to close the
aperture. (<i>b</i>) <i>Holostomata</i> (or Whole-mouthed). In these the
siphon is not so produced, and does not want to be protected;
accordingly the mouth of the shell is <i>entire</i>, <i>i.e.</i> has no canal.
The operculum is horny or shelly.
The former (group <i>a</i>) includes
several families:</p>

<p>1. <i>Strombid&aelig;</i>, comprising shells, like the huge <i>Strombus</i>, or
"Fountain-shell," which is so often used to adorn the mantelpiece
or rockery, and from which cameos are cut.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Muricid&aelig;</i>, of which the <i>Murex</i> (an extraordinary form of
this is the "Venus' comb," <i>Murex tenuispina</i>, <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Sect_2_Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>),</span> the Mitre-shells,
and the Red-Whelks (<i>Fusus</i>) are examples.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Buccinid&aelig;</i>, taking its name from its type, the Common
Whelk (<i>Buccinum undatum</i>), and including such other forms
as the Dog-Whelk (<i>Nassa</i>), the <i>Purpura</i>, the strange <i>Magilus</i>,
and the lovely Harp-Shells and Olives <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).</span></p>

<p>4. The <i>Cassidid&aelig;</i>, or "Helmet-Shells." <i>Cassis rufa</i>, from West
Africa, is noted as the best species of shell for cameo engraving;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
with it are classed the "Tun" (<i>Dolium</i>) and the great
"Triton" (<i>Triton tritonis</i>), such as the sea-gods
of mythology are represented blowing into by way
of trumpet, and which are used by the Polynesian
Islanders to this day instead of horns.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 10. Oliva tessellata.</span>
</div>

<p>5. The <i>Conid&aelig;</i>, whose type, the "Cone-shell" <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_11">Fig.
11</a>),</span> is at once distinctive and handsome, but which in
the living state is covered by a dull yellowish-brown
periostracum that has to be carefully removed before
the full beauties of the shell are displayed.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Volutid&aelig;</i>, embracing the Volutes and
"Boat-shells" (<i>Cymba</i>).</p>

<p>7. The <i>Cypr&aelig;id&aelig;</i>, or Cowries (<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>), which owe
their high polish to the size of the shell-secreting
organ (mantle), whose edges meet over the back of
the shell, concealing it within its folds. With
these is classed the "China-shell" (<i>Ovulum</i>).</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 11. Conus vermiculatus.</span>
</div>

<p>The second group, or <i>Holostomata</i>, is divided into nineteen families, beginning with&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>Naticid&aelig;</i>, whose type, the genus <i>Natica</i>,
is well known to all shell-collectors through the common <i>Natica monilifera</i> of our coasts.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Cancellariad&aelig;</i>, in which the shells are cancellated or cross-barred by a double
series of lines running, one set with the whorls, and the other across them.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Pyramidellid&aelig;</i>, which are high-spired, elongated, and slender shells, with the
exception of the genus <i>Stylina</i>, which lives attached to the spines of
sea-urchins or buried in living star-fishes and corals.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 12. Cypr&aelig;a oniscus.</span>
</div>

<p>4. The <i>Solarid&aelig;</i> or "Staircase-shells," whose umbilicus is so wide that, as you look down it, the projecting
edges of the whorls appear like a winding staircase. It is a very short-spired shell.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Scalarid&aelig;</i>, "Wentle-traps" or "Ladder-shells," which may be readily recognised from their white and lustrous
appearance and the strong rib-like markings of the periodic mouths that encircle the whorls.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Cerithiad&aelig;</i>, or "Horn-shells," which are very high-spired,
and whose columella and anterior canal are produced in the form of an impudent little tail, the effect of which, however,
in the genus <i>Aporrhais</i>, or "Spout-shells," is taken away by the expanded and thickened lip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span></p>

<p>7. In the next family, the <i>Turritellid&aelig;</i>, or "Tower-shells," the
type Turritella is spiral; but in the allied form <i>Vermetus</i>, though
the spire begins in the natural manner, it goes off into a twisted
tube resembling somewhat an ill-made corkscrew. The mouth
in this family is often nearly round.</p>

<p>8. The <i>Melaniad&aelig;</i>, and 9. The <i>Paludinid&aelig;</i>, are fresh-water
shells. The former are turreted, and the latter conical or
globular. Both are furnished with opercula, but the mouth in
the first is more or less oval and frequently notched in front,
while in the latter it is rounded and entire.</p>

<p>10. The <i>Litorinid&aelig;</i>, or Periwinkles, need no word from us.</p>

<p>11. The <i>Calyptr&aelig;id&aelig;</i> comprise the "Bonnet-limpet," or
<i>Pileopsis</i>, and "Cup-and-saucer-limpets" (<i>Calyptr&aelig;a</i>). They
may be described briefly as limpets with traces of a spire left.
The genus <i>Phorus</i>, however, is spiral, and resembles a <i>Trochus</i>.
They have been called "Carriers" from their strange habit of
building any stray fragments of shell or stone into their house,
thus rendering themselves almost indistinguishable from the
ground on which they crawl.</p>

<p>12. The <i>Turbinid&aelig;</i>, or "Top-shells," are next in order, and
of these the great <i>Turbo marmoreus</i> is a well-known example,
being prepared as an ornament for the whatnot or mantelpiece
by removing the external layer of the shell in order to display
the brilliant pearly nacre below. These mollusca close their
mouths with a horny operculum, coated on its exterior by a thick
layer of porcelain-like shelly matter. With them are classed
the familiar <i>Trochus</i> and other closely allied genera.</p>

<p>13. The <i>Haliotid&aelig;</i> offer in the representative genus <i>Haliotis</i>,
or the "Ear-shell," another familiar mantelpiece ornament.</p>

<p>14. The <i>Ianthinid&aelig;</i>, or "Violet-snails," that float about in
mid-Atlantic upon the gulf-weed, and at certain seasons secrete
a curious float or raft, to which their eggs are attached, are next
in order, and are followed by&mdash;</p>

<p>15. The <i>Fissurellid&aelig;</i>, or "Key-hole" and "Notched limpets,"
whose name sufficiently describes them. To these succeed&mdash;</p>

<p>16. The <i>Neritid&aelig;</i>, an unmistakable group of globular shells,
having next to no spire and a very glossy exterior, generally
ornamented with a great variety of spots and bands.</p>

<p>17. The <i>Patellid&aelig;</i>, or true Limpets, are well known to every
sea-side visitor: large species, as much as two inches across, are
to be found on the coast of Devon, but these are pigmies compared
with a South American variety which attains a foot in
diameter.</p>

<p>18. The <i>Dentaliad&aelig;</i>, represented by the genus <i>Dentalium</i>, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
"Tooth-shell," are simply slightly curved tubes, open at both
ends and tapering from the mouth downwards, and cannot be
mistaken.</p>

<p>19. Lastly, we have the <i>Chitonid&aelig;</i>, whose single genus <i>Chiton</i>
possesses shells differing from all other mollusca in being composed
of eight plates overlapping each other, and in appearance
reminding one of the wood-louse. This animal is not only like
the limpet in form but also in habits, being found adhering to
the rocks and stones at low-water.</p>

<p>Order II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pulmonifera.</span> Contains the air-breathing
<i>Gasteropods</i>, and to it consequently belong all the terrestrial
mollusca, though some few aquatic genera are also included.
The members of this order have an air-chamber instead of gills,
and are divided into two groups, (<i>a</i>) those without an operculum,
and (<i>b</i>) those having an operculum. Foremost in the first group
stands the great family&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Helicid&aelig;</i>, named after its chief representative, the
genus <i>Helix</i>. It also includes the "Glass-shell" (<i>Vitrina</i>),
the "Amber-shell" (<i>Succinea</i>), and such genera as <i>Bulimus</i>,
<i>Achatina</i>, <i>Pupa</i>, <i>Clausilia</i>
<span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>),</span> etc.,
which differ from the typical <i>Helix</i> in appearance,
possessing as they do comparatively high spires.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Limacid&aelig;</i>, or "slugs," follow next; of these only
one, the genus <i>Testacella</i>, has an external shell stuck on the end
of its tail; the rest have either a more or less imperfect shell concealed
underneath the mantle, or else none at all.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Oncidiad&aelig;</i> are slug-like, and devoid of shell.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Limn&aelig;id&aelig;</i> embrace the "Pond-snails," chief of whom
is the well-known, high-spired <i>Limn&aelig;a stagnalis</i>. Other shells
of this family associated with <i>Limn&aelig;a</i> are, however, very
different in shape; for instance, <i>Physa</i> has its whorls turning to
the left instead of to the right; <i>Ancylus</i> <a name="Ancylus"></a><span class="nowrap">(<a href="#missing_24"><ins title="Correction - Figure missing">Fig. 24</ins></a>),</span> or the freshwater
limpet, is of course limpet-like; while <i>Planorbis</i>, or the
"Coil-shell," is wound like a watch-spring.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Auriculid&aelig;</i> includes both spiral shells, such as <i>Auricula</i>
and <i>Charychium</i>, and a limpet-like one <i>Siphonaria</i>.</p>

<p>At the head of group <i>b</i> stands 1, <i>Cyclostomid&aelig;</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
<i>Cyclostoma elegans</i> is a common shell on our chalk-downs, and well illustrates
its family, in which the mouth is nearly circular. Foreign
examples of this genus are much esteemed by collectors. The
other two families are, (2) <i>Helicinid&aelig;</i> and (3) <i>Aciculid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>Order III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Opisthobranchiata.</span> These
animals carry their gills exposed on the back and sides, towards the
rear of the body. Only a few have any shell. 1. The <i>Tornatellid&aelig;</i>,
which have a stout little spiral shell. 2. The <i>Bullid&aelig;</i>, in which
the spire is concealed <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_14"><ins title='Correction was Fig. 26"'>Fig. 14</ins></a>).</span>
3. The <i>Aplysiad&aelig;</i>, where the shell is flat and oblong or triangular
in shape. The remaining families are slug-like and shell-less.</p>

<p>Order IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nucleobranchiata.</span> Derives
its name from the fact that the animals constituting it have their respiratory
and digestive organs in a sort of nucleus on the posterior part of the back,
and covered by a minute shell. As they are pelagic, the shells are not readily
to be obtained. They are divided into two families, <i>Firolid&aelig;</i> and
<i>Atlantid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLASS III.&mdash;PTEROPODA. Like the last, these pretty
little mollusca are ocean-swimmers. The members of one
division of them, to which the <i>Cleodora</i> belongs, is furnished
with iridescent external shells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLASS IV.&mdash;The LAMELLIBRANCHIATA (Plate-gilled),
or <span class="smcap">Conchifera</span> (Shell-bearing), includes the mollusca
commonly known as "bivalves," the animal being snugly hidden
between two more or less closely fitting shelly valves. The oysters,
cockles, etc., are examples of this class. The two valves are
fastened together near their points, or beaks (technically called
<i>umbones</i>), by a tough elastic ligament, sometimes supplemented
by an internal cartilage. If this be severed and the valves parted,
it will be found that in most cases they are further articulated by
projecting ridges or points called the <i>teeth</i>, which, when the
valves are together, interlock and form a hinge; the margin of
the shell on which the teeth and ligament are situated is termed
the <i>hinge-line</i>. A bivalve is said to be <i>equivalve</i> when the two
shells composing it are of the same size, <i>inequivalve</i> when they
are not. If the umbones are in the middle, the shell is <i>equilateral</i>
<span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>);</span> but <i>inequilateral</i> when they are nearer one side
than the other <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>).</span> If the shell be an oyster or a scallop,
you will find on the inside a single circular scar-like mark near the

centre; this is the point to which the muscles that close the valves
and hold them so tightly together are attached. In the majority of
bivalves, however, there are two such muscular impressions, or scars,
one on either side of each valve of the shell. The former group
on this account are often called <i>Monomyaria</i> (having one shell-muscle),
and the latter <i>Dimyaria</i> (having two shell-muscles). In the
last named the two muscular impressions are united by a fine groove
(or <i>pallial-line</i>), which in some runs parallel to the margin of
the shell <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>),</span> whilst in others it makes a bend in (<i>pallial-sinus</i>)
on one side of the valve towards the centre <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>).</span>
In Monomyaria it will be found running parallel to the margin
of the shell. It marks the line of attachment of the mantle or
shell-secreting organ of the animal to the shell which grows by
the addition of fresh matter along its edges, so that the concentric
curved markings so often seen on the exterior correspond
in their origin with the periodic mouths of the Gasteropods. The
bivalves are all aquatic, and many bury themselves in
the sand or mud by means of a fleshy,
muscular foot. These are furnished with two siphons, or fleshy
tubes, sometimes united, sometimes separate, through which
they respire, drawing the water in through one and expelling it
by the other. Those kinds whose habit it is to bury themselves
below the surface of the mud or sand are furnished with long
retractile siphons, and to admit of their withdrawal into the
shell, the mantle is at this point attached farther back, giving
rise to the <i>pallial-sinus</i> above described; this sinus is deeper as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
the siphons are proportionately longer, and in many cases, too,
the valves do not meet at this point when the shell is closed.</p>

<p>Attention to these particulars is necessary when arranging
your bivalves, as on them their classification depends, the class
being divided into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Asiphonida</span> (Siphonless).</p>

<p>1. The <i>Ostreid&aelig;</i>, or oysters, which are deservedly a distinct
family in themselves.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Anomiad&aelig;</i>, comprising the multiform and curiously
constructed <i>Anomia</i>, with the "Window-shells" (<i>Placuna</i>).</p>

<p>3. The <i>Pectinid&aelig;</i>, taking its name from the genus <i>Pecten</i>, or
"Scallop-shells," of which one kind (<i>P. maximus</i>) is frequently
to be seen at the fishmongers' shops. The "Thorney oysters"
(<i>Spondylus</i>) take rank here, and are highly esteemed by collectors,
one specimen indeed having been valued at £25!</p>

<p>4. The <i>Aviculid&aelig;</i>, or "Wing-shells," among which are numbered
the "Pearl-oyster" of commerce (<i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i>).
The strange T-shaped "Hammer oyster" belongs
to this family, as does also the <i>Pinna</i>. The Pinnas, like the
mussels and some other bivalves, moor themselves
to rocks by means of a number of threads spun by the foot of the
mollusc, and termed the <i>byssus</i>, which in this genus is finer,
more silky, than in any other, and has been woven into articles
of dress.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Mytilid&aelig;</i>, or mussels, including the <i>Lithodomus</i>, or
"Date-shell," which bores into corals and even hard limestone
rocks.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Arcad&aelig;</i>, or "Noah's-ark-shells," characterized by
their long straight hinge-line set with numerous very fine teeth
<span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>).</span> The "Nut-shell" (<i>Nucula</i>) belongs to this family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span></p>

<p>7. The <i>Trigoniad&aelig;</i>, whose single living genus, the handsome <i>Trigonia</i>
<span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>),</span> is confined to the Australian coast-line, whereas in times now long
past they had a world-wide distribution.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Tridacnid&aelig;</i>, whose sole genus <i>Tridacna</i> contains the
largest specimen of the whole class of bivalves, the shells sometimes
measuring two feet and more across.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Cardiad&aelig;</i>, or cockles.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Lucinid&aelig;</i>, in which the valves are nearly circular, and as a
rule not very attractive in appearance, though the "Basket-shell"
(<i>Corbis</i>) has an elegantly sculptured exterior.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Cycladid&aelig;</i>, whose typical genus <i>Cyclas</i>, with its round form
and thin horny shell, is to be found in most of our ponds and streams.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Astartid&aelig;</i>, a family of shells having very strongly developed
teeth, and the surface of whose valves is often concentrically ribbed.</p>

<p>7. The <i>Cyprinid&aelig;</i>, which have very solid oval or elongated
shells and conspicuous teeth <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>).</span>
The "Heart-cockle" (<i>Isocardia</i>) belongs to this family.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Venerid&aelig;</i>. The hard, solid shells of this family are for
elegance of form and beauty of colour amongst the most attractive a collector
can posses. Their shells are more or less oval and have three teeth in each valve <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>).</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The <i>Mactrid&aelig;</i> are somewhat triangular in shape, and
may be at once recognised by the pit for the hinge-ligament, which
also assumes that form, as seen in the accompanying figure of <i>Lutraria
elliptica</i> <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>).</span></p>

<p>3. The <i>Tellinid&aelig;</i> comprise some of the most delicately tinted,
both externally and internally, of all shells. In some, coloured
bands radiate from the umbones, and well bear out the fanciful
name of "Sunset shells" bestowed upon them. Their valves
are generally much compressed.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Solenid&aelig;</i>, or "Razor-shells," rank next, and are readily recognised by the extreme length of
the valves in proportion to their width, and also by their gaping at both ends.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Myacid&aelig;</i> or "Gapers," have the siphonal ends wide apart (in the genus <i>Mya</i> both ends
gape), and are further characterized by the triangular process for the cartilage, which projects into the
interior of the shell. One valve (the left) is generally smaller than the other.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Anatinid&aelig;</i> have thin, often inequivalve pearly shells. The genus <i>Pandora</i> is the form most
frequently met with in collections.</p>

<p>7. The <i>Gastroch&aelig;nid&aelig;</i> embraces two genera (<i>Gastroch&aelig;na</i> and <i>Saxicava</i>) of boring mollusca,
which perforate shells and rocks, and also, the remarkable tube-like "Watering-pot-shell" (<i>Aspergillum</i>)
which is hardly recognisable as a bivalve at all.</p>

<p>8. The <i>Pholadid&aelig;</i> concludes the list of bivalves, and comprises the common rock-boring Pholas
<span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>)</span> of our coasts
and the wood-boring shipworm "Teredo" <span class="nowrap">(<a href="#Sect_2_Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>).</span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Although the <i>Brachiopoda</i>, or "Lamp-shells," are not true mollusca,
they are not very far removed from them, and are so often to be found in
cabinets that it will not do to pass them over, especially since in
past times they were very abundant, an enormous number occurring in the fossil
state. Only eight genera are now living. Shells belonging to this class are
readily recognised by the fact of one valve being larger than the other, and
possessing a distinct

<p>The object of the young collector should be to obtain examples
of as many <i>genera</i> as possible, since a collection in which a great
number of genera are represented is far more useful and instructive
than one composed of a great many species referable to but
few genera. He will also find it very convenient to separate
the British Shells from his general collection, sub-dividing them
for convenience into "Land and Fresh-water," and "Marine."
Of these he should endeavour to get every species, and even
variety, making the thing as complete as possible. Or a separate
collection may be made of all those kinds which he can find
within a certain distance of his own home. A collection of this
sort possesses, in addition to its scientific worth, an interest of
<ins title='Correction - was "tis"'>its</ins> own, owing to the local associations that invariably connect
themselves with it.</p>

<p>Geology is of all "hobbies" the one best calculated not only
to develop the physical powers, but also, if pursued with any
degree of earnestness, to train and extend the mental faculties.
To study geology properly, the rocks themselves must be visited
and carefully observed, their appearance noted, and the fossils,
if any, which they contain, collected. This necessitates many
a pleasant walk into the open country to quarries and cuttings,
or rambles along the sea-shore to cliffs which may be
worth investigating, whilst botany, entomology, or any other
congenial pursuit, may be followed on the way; for natural
science in its different branches has so many points of connection
that it is impossible to study one of them without increasing
one's interest in, and knowledge of, all the others. Again,
in arranging, classifying, and studying at home the specimens
collected on these expeditions, many an hour may be usefully
spent; habits of exactitude and neatness are acquired; whilst
in endeavouring to draw correct conclusions as to the way in
which particular rocks were formed, and by what agencies
brought to their present position, the reasoning faculties are
exercised and developed.</p>

<p>The existence of fossil shells and bones in various strata of the
earth's crust attracted attention at a very early date of the
world's history; the Egyptian priests were aware of the existence
of marine shells in the hills bounding the Nile valley,
and from this fact Herodotus drew the conclusion that the sea
formerly covered the spot. The bones of the larger mammalia
(rhinoceros, elephant, etc.), were, however, thought by the
ancients to be human, and hence arose the idea of a race of
giants having existed at some previous period of the earth's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
history. It was not, however, until near the end of the last
century that geology began to be recognised as a science, and
the true bearing of fossils in relation to the rocks in which they
were found was conclusively proved. William Smith in England,
and Werner in Germany, while working independently of
each other, both came to the same conclusion, viz. that the numerous
strata invariably rested on each other in a certain order,
and that this order was never inverted,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> whilst William Smith in
addition proved that each group of rocks, and even each stratum,
had its own peculiar set of fossils, by which it might be recognised
wherever it occurred. From that time forth the study of the
various fossils began to be considered as a separate science
apart from that of the beds containing them; this is now known
as Pal&aelig;ontology, the study of the composition of the rocks themselves
being termed Petrology.</p>

<p>At this moment, however, we are less concerned with the
study of rocks and fossils than with the best and simplest way
of collecting, preparing, and arranging specimens as a means to
this study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="THE_CABINET"></a>
<div class="caption2">THE CABINET.</div>

<p>With regard to the cabinet for such specimens as you are
able to collect, the same advice holds good as that given
in a previous Manual (The Young Collector's Shell Book),
namely, the simpler the cabinet the better, though of course
card-board boxes would not as a rule be strong enough to stand
the weight of the specimens, and hence it is advisable to have
wooden ones. The boxes in which Oakey's Wellington Knife-powder
is sent out (they measure about 15 in. × 10 in. × 3
in.) are on the whole the most convenient size, and are easily
obtainable at any oil and colourman's. These, when painted
over with Berlin Black, after first removing the external labels,
look very neat. The inside may be papered according to taste,
when the trays may be arranged in order ready for the reception
of your specimens.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Except in such cases where the rocks themselves have been displaced
by movements of the earth's crust.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="IMPLEMENTS_REQUIRED"></a>
<div class="caption2">IMPLEMENTS REQUIRED WHEN COLLECTING.</div>

<p>A certain amount of apparatus is needful in collecting geological
specimens. It is necessary to break open the hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
rocks in order to get at the fossils within, and for this purpose
a strong hammer is required. One end of the hammer-head
should be square, tapering, slightly, to a flat striking face;
for when thus shaped the edges and corners are less likely to
break off; the other side should be produced into a rather long,
flat, and slightly curved pick, terminating in a chisel-edge at
right-angles to the handle; the total length of the head should
not exceed 9&frac12; in., the striking face being 3 in. from the centre
of the eye in which the handle (18 in. long) is inserted; the
latter should be made of the toughest ash, American hickory,
or "green-heart," and fixed in with an iron wedge ("roughed"
to prevent its coming out again), taking care that &frac14; in. of the
handle protrudes on the other side. It is the usual practice,
but a mistaken one, to cut it off level with the hammer head,
which is likely, under these circumstances, to come off after it
has been in use for a time, whereas, by leaving a small portion
of the wedged-out end projecting, this mischance is avoided, and
your weapon will not fail even when used to drag its owner up
a stiff ascent. It is better to shape and fix the handle yourself,
as by this means you can not only cut it to fit your hand, but may
rely upon its being properly fastened in. By filing grooves
around it an inch apart, it will serve to take rough measurements
with, while a firm grasp may be insured by bees-waxing
instead of polishing it. Another and much smaller hammer
will also be necessary, chiefly for home use, to trim the specimens
before putting them away in the cabinet; the head of this
hammer must not be more than 2&frac12; inches long, the handle
springing from the centre; one end has a flat striking face,
square in section, the other, instead of being formed like a pick,
is wedge-shaped, the sharp edge being at right-angles to the
handle. Next to a hammer, a cold chisel is indispensable to
the collector, since without its aid many a choice specimen
embedded in the middle of a mass of rock too large to break
with the hammer would have to be left behind. There is one
thing, however, to beware of in using this tool&mdash;it has sometimes
to be hit with great force, and should you chance to miss it and
strike your hand instead, the result may be more serious than
even a severe bruise. To prevent this, procure from the shoe-maker
or saddler a piece of thick leather, about 4 inches in
diameter, having a hole cut in the centre through which to pass
the shank of the chisel, and, thus protected, you may wield the
hammer with impunity.</p>

<p>For digging fossils out of clay, an old, stout knife, such as
the worn-down stump of a carver, is handy, and in sandy beds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
an ordinary garden trowel is very useful, whilst in a chalk-pit a
small saw is sometimes of great aid in extricating a desirable
specimen. The same may be said of an ordinary carpenter's
wood-chisel. For picking up small and delicate specimens, a
pair of forceps should be carried, whilst without a pocket lens
no true naturalist ever stirs abroad. An ordinary stout
canvas satchel, such as is commonly used by schoolboys, is the
best thing for carrying home your specimens; this may be
made much stronger by the addition of two short strips of
leather stitched on the back and running, one from each ring,
to which the strap passing over the shoulder is fastened, down
to the bottom of the bag; by leaving a small portion unstitched
near the bottom of each of these, wide enough for the shoulder-strap
to pass through, the satchel may at a moment's notice be
slung knapsackwise on the shoulders&mdash;a method of carrying it
which is, as all who have tried it know, by far the most convenient
when it is heavily laden or not in immediate requisition.
A stout leather belt may be worn in which to carry all your
hammers, supporting it on the side where the heavy hammer
hangs by a band passing over the opposite shoulder. Before
starting on an excursion, make a practice of seeing that you
have everything with you, or when the critical moment comes,
and some choice and fragile specimen is ready to be borne
off, you may find that you are without the means necessary
for taking it home. For ordinary hard specimens, newspaper
well crumpled around them is without its equal, but some of
the more delicate must be first wrapped in tissue paper or even
cotton-wool, whilst the most fragile fossils should be packed
in tins with bran or sawdust, the particles of which fill in all the
corners and press equally everywhere, a useful faculty which
cotton wool does not possess. When neither of these are to be
obtained, dry sand will answer quite as well, though it is heavier
to carry.</p>

<p>Although not absolutely necessary in the field, it is often useful
to have a small bottle of acid in your pocket (nitric acid diluted
to 1-12th with distilled water is the best) with which to test for
limestones; a drop of acid placed on a rock will, if there be
any carbonate of lime in it, immediately begin to fizz. Finally,
every young collector should carry a note-book, and carefully
record in it what he sees in each pit he visits, while, if it can
be procured or borrowed, a geological map of the district you
are exploring is a great help, for with its aid and that of a good
compass you become practically independent of much extraneous
assistance.</p>

<a name="USE_YOUR_IMPLEMENTS"></a>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span></p>
<div class="caption2">HOW TO USE YOUR IMPLEMENTS.</div>

<p>We will suppose by way of illustration that near us flows a
river, on the rising ground above which is a pit that we propose
to visit for the purpose of putting our apparatus into practical
operation. When we have reached the floor of the pit, and
stand looking up at the section before us, we are at first
rather puzzled as to what the beds, which we see before us,
are; for as the pit has not been worked for some time, its
sides are partially overgrown with grass, and in places bits
and pieces of the upper beds have fallen down and form a
heap beneath which the lower ones lie buried. We must therefore
make our way to those spots where the beds are left clear,
and find out, if possible, what they are. By climbing up one of
the heaps of fallen earth (<i>talus</i>) we reach the top, where, first of
all, under the roots of the grass and shrubs, we find the mould in
which these grow, and which is formed of the broken up (<i>disintegrated</i>)
rocks forming the still higher ground above, and which
the rains, frosts and snows, aided afterwards by the earthworms,
have converted into mould. This, geologically speaking, is
called <i>surface soil</i>, and is here about two feet deep. Just below
it we find a layer of coarse gravel; the pebbles of which this is
composed are of all sorts, sizes, and shapes, and are stained a
deep brown by oxide of iron. Most of them are flints, and by
diligent search you may find casts and impressions in these of
sponges, shells, spines of sea urchins, etc. Flints, whether from
gravel or their parent rock the chalk, are easiest broken by a
light smart tap of the hammer, though when it is desired to
shape them for the cabinet a soft iron hammer should be used,
and the piece to be shaped placed on a soft pad on the knee,
for when struck with a steel hammer flints splinter in all
directions, and often through the very portion you most desire
to preserve. In one spot we find a mass of sand included in
the gravel; this mass is thickest in the middle, and tapers
away towards each end, its total length being about fifty feet.
Could we see the whole mass, we should probably find it to
be a patch lying on the gravel and thinning out all around its
edges; in other words it would be shaped like a lens&mdash;"<i>lenticular</i>"
as geologists term it. When we examine this mass more
closely, we find that the layers of sand do not run parallel with
the bed, but are inclined in different directions, sometimes lying
one way, sometimes another. This <i>false bedding</i> is due to the
sand having been thrown down in waters agitated by strong
currents that swept over the spot, now in one direction and now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
in another, scattering at one moment half the sand they had just
piled up one way only to redeposit it the next minute in another.
In the gravel also may be observed a similar though less marked
arrangement, owing to the larger size of its constituents, which
of course required a still stronger current action to wash them
down.</p>

<p>Amongst the sand we now see some shells, and set to work to
dig them out very carefully, for they are exceedingly brittle.
The best specimens are to be obtained by throwing down masses of
the sandy material and searching in it; but only the stronger and
finer examples will bear such usage. We next notice that these
shells are precisely similar to those still found with living occupants
in the river below, only they are no longer of a brownish
colour, but owing to the loss of the animal matter of the shell
have an earthy, dirty-white appearance. To carry these home
they should be packed in bran in one of your tins with a note as
follows made on a piece of paper and placed just inside&mdash;"Sand
in gravel: topmost bed &mdash;&mdash; pit, August 2nd, 188-."  Then if
you are not able to work them out at once on reaching home,
you will not forget whence they came. From the appearance
of these sands and gravels, and the presence in them of shells
exactly like those in the river below, it may reasonably be inferred
that they once formed a portion of the bed of that river
long ago, before it had scooped out its valley to the present
depth. There is, however, something else in this sand-bed&mdash;a
piece of bone protruding; clear away the sand above it, and dig
back until the whole is visible. It is broken through in one or
two places, but otherwise is in fair condition; remove the pieces
carefully one by one, and wrap them in separate pieces of paper,
and then proceed to search for others. These bones, which are
plentiful in some of our river valley gravel-beds, are the remains
of animals that once roamed in the forests which at that time
covered the country; they were probably either drowned in
crossing the water, or got stuck in the mud on the banks on
coming down to drink. A fine collection was made at Ilford
by the late Sir Antonio Brady, and is now in the British
Museum (Natural History) at South Kensington. Besides the
bones of animals, you may expect to find examples of all, or
nearly all, the different rocks in which the river has cut its
valley, and samples of these may be picked out and taken
home. Each specimen should be wrapped in a separate piece of
paper to prevent its rubbing against others, care being taken to
note the locality either by writing it on the paper or by affixing to
the specimen a number corresponding to one in your note book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
against the description you have written of the bed. The gravel,
with its accompanying bed of sand, may be traced down, by
scraping away the surface, for about ten feet, when you will discover
that it rests unevenly upon the beds below, which, instead
of being horizontal, slope (<i>dip</i>) in a N.N.E. direction, making
an angle of about 45° with the floor of the pit; the gravel therefore
rests successively upon the upturned ends of the lower beds,
and, geologically speaking, is "unconformable" to them. Now as
these underlying rocks were of course originally deposited in an
horizontal position, they must have been pushed up and the upper
parts worn away (<i>denuded</i>) before the gravel was deposited on
them, for the accomplishment of which process an amount of
time must have elapsed that it would be impossible to reckon by
years.</p>

<p>When we come to examine these lower beds, we find first a
stratum of stiff dark-brown clay containing fossils disposed in
layers: those near the outer surface have been rendered so
brittle by the weather, that it is necessary to make use of the pick
end of the hammer and dig a little way into the face of the
section before we come upon some which will bear removal by
cutting them out with a knife. Pack them in a tin with bran,
or, where much clay still adheres to them, wrap them in paper.</p>

<p>The true top of this bed is not visible, being concealed
beneath a heap of earth in the corner of the pit, but we can see
and measure about six feet of it.</p>

<p>The next bed in order is a light brownish band of sandy clay
that splits along its layers into thin pieces or "<i>lamin&aelig;</i>," whence
we may describe it as a sandy, <i>laminated</i> clay. On the freshly
split surface of one piece we see scattered a number of small
darker brown fragments; an examination with a pocket lens
clearly shows that these are little bits of leaves and stems, with
here and there a more perfect specimen. These beds must
have been deposited in the still waters just off the main stream of
a large river which brought the plants floating down to this spot,
where they became water-logged and sunk; so, too, if you examine
the shells in the bed immediately above, you will see that they are
very like though not the same as those which at the present day
love to dwell in the mud off the estuaries of big rivers in warmer
parts of the globe; hence we discover that at some far distant
period a big river, but one which had no connection with that
running close by, once flowed over this very spot. On tracing
the leaf-bed down, we come all at once, at about three feet from
its upper surface, upon a narrow band one or two inches thick of
a substance composed of numerous bits of sticks and stalks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
closely matted together and partially mineralized. Vegetable
matter in this form is known as lignite, and is one of the first
stages towards the formation of coal out of plant remains. Below
this lignite band we find our leaf-bed getting sandier and
sandier, and losing all trace of the plants by degrees till it becomes
almost pure sand. Here and there, however, it contains some
curiously shaped masses, which, when broken through with the
hammer, seem composed of nothing but the same grains of sand
cemented together into a hard mass. In one there is, however, a
curiously shaped hollow, which, upon examining it closely, you
will see is a perfect cast of a small shell that has itself disappeared.
A drop of acid on it fizzes away and sinks in between the grains
of sand which in this spot become loose. A mass of sand or
particles of clay thus cemented together, be it by iron, lime, or
any other substance, is termed a "<i>nodule</i>" or "<i>concretion</i>,"
and in this particular instance has been formed as follows:&mdash;The
rain-water falling on the sand where it comes to the surface sinks
in and filters through the bed. Now there is always a certain
amount of carbonic acid in rain-water, and this acid acted on
the carbonate of lime of which the shell was composed, dissolving
and dispersing it amongst the neighbouring grains of
sand where it was re-deposited, cementing them together as we
have seen. The bottom of this bed of sand we find to be just
fifteen feet from the lignite band when measured at right-angles
to the bed, and it is succeeded by a hard greyish rock, which
requires a smart blow of the hammer to break it, but the surface
of which, where it has been exposed to the weather, is much
crumbled ("<i>weathered</i>"), and breaks readily into small pieces.
It is easily scratched with the point of a knife, and therefore is
not flint; moreover, it fizzes strongly when touched with acid&mdash;hence
there is a great deal of carbonate of lime in it, and we
know that it is limestone.</p>

<p>Limestones are very largely, sometimes almost entirely, made
up of the calcareous portions of marine creatures, such as the hard
parts of corals, the tests of sea-urchins, the shells of mollusca,
etc., welded, so to speak, into one mass by the heat, pressure, and
chemical changes which the bed has undergone since its deposition
at the bottom of the sea. There would be every reason,
therefore, one might suppose, to expect a number of fossils in
this bed; but, alas! disappointment awaits the young explorer, for
with the exception of chalk and a few other limestones, these
rocks are generally of such uniform texture that on being struck
with the hammer they split through fossils and all, the fractured
surface only too frequently showing nought save a few obscure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
markings. But what we fail to accomplish in our impatience,
nature effects by slow degrees, and if you will turn over the
weathered pieces and blocks lying about, you will soon find
plenty of fossils sticking out all over them; by a judicious use of
hammer and chisel any of these may be detached and added to
your stock, each being separately packed in paper and the
locality written on the outside. Some seventy or eighty feet is
all that is visible of this limestone; the rest is unexcavated.</p>

<p>Before leaving the pit, it will be as well to select such rock
specimens as you wish to place in your cabinet, trimming them
to the required size on the spot, for should you, as is not unlikely,
spoil two or three, you can readily pick a fresh one. Having
secured our specimens, we will take a look at our note-book, to
see if we have noted all the details we require. If so, our
entries should run something as follows:&mdash;First, we have made
a rough sketch of the position of the beds, carefully numbering
each one; then follow our notes on the individual beds, preceded
by numbers corresponding with those in the sketch,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Our imaginary pit is of course only a sort of geological Juan
Fernandez, but it will serve in some degree to illustrate the method
of dealing with various rocks and fossils when met with in the
field, and how they may best be collected and carried home.
A few additional suggestions where to look for fossils may,
however, be given here. To begin with, <ins title='Correction was "inever"'>I never</ins> neglect to search
the fallen masses, especially their weathered surfaces, or to look
carefully over the heaps of quarried materials, whatever they
may happen to be, piled on the floor of the pit. In working at
the beds themselves, remember that fossils frequently occur in
layers which of course represent the old sea-bottom of the
period; to find these, it is necessary to follow the beds in a
direction at right angles to their stratification, till you arrive at
the sought-for layers, or <i>zones</i>.</p>

<p>Do not be surprised, when collecting from a formation you
have never before studied, if the fossils are not at first apparent,
though many are known to be present. The eye requires a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
days in which to become accustomed to its fresh surroundings,
and when the same spot has been carefully hunted over every
day for a week, it is astonishing what a quantity of fossils are
discernible where not one in the first instance was recognised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="PREPARE_THE_SPECIMENS"></a>
<div class="caption2">HOW TO PREPARE THE SPECIMENS FOR THE CABINET.</div>

<p>The first thing to be done on unpacking our specimens is to
pick out those which require the least attention, and get them
out of the way. These will be your rock specimens, which, if
they have been trimmed properly in the pit, will not need much
further manipulation; a word or two, however, as to the best
method of proceeding when it is desirable to reduce a specimen,
will not be out of place. If you wish to divide it in two, or
detach any considerable portion, the specimen may, while held
in the hand, be struck a smart blow with the hammer; as, however,
it not frequently happens that even with the greatest care
the specimen under this treatment breaks in an opposite direction
to that required, it is advisable to adopt a somewhat surer
method, namely, to procure a block of tough wood, and in the
centre bore a hole just large enough to receive the shank of the
cold chisel, and thus hold it in an upright position with the
cutting edge uppermost; placing the specimen on this, and then
hitting it immediately above with the hammer, it may be fractured
through in any required direction. To trim off a small
projection, hold the specimen in your hand with the corner
towards you and directed slightly downwards, then with the
edge of the striking face of the hammer hit it a smart blow at
the line along which you wish it to break off; the object of
inclining the specimen is to make sure that the blow shall fall
in a direction inclined away from the portion you wish to preserve,
a <i>modus operandi</i> which it is necessary to bear well in
mind if you would not spoil many a choice specimen. Anything
beyond very general directions, however, it is impossible to give
in such matters as this: experience, and a few hints from those
who have themselves had practice in collecting and arranging
specimens, are worth more than any written description, however
lengthy and elaborate.</p>

<p>Having reduced your specimen to the required size and shape,
the next thing to be done is to write a neat little label for it&mdash;the
smaller the better&mdash;stating, first the nature of the specimen,
secondly the geological formation to which it belongs, thirdly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
the locality from which it was procured, and fourthly the date
when acquired, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
Limestone.<br />
Lower Carboniferous.<br />
Quarry, 1 mile N.W. of &mdash;&mdash;<br />
21. 8. 8-.<br />
</div>
<br />

<div class="justify">ruling a neat line at the top and bottom (red ink lines give a
more finished appearance than black). When the label is dry,
damp it to render it more pliant, and gum it on to the flattest
available surface of the specimen, pressing it well into any small
inequalities that it may hold the firmer. A small quantity of
pure glycerine (about an eighth part) should be added to the gum
before use, in order to prevent its drying hard and brittle. The
specimen is now ready to place in its tray and be put away in
the cabinet.</div>

<p>In the next place, pick out the fossils which you obtained from
the limestone. With the cold chisel set in its block of wood,
and the trimming hammer, remove as much of the surrounding
rock (<i>matrix</i>) as you can without damaging the fossil, and with
a smaller chisel any pieces that may be sticking to and obscuring
it. Fossils in soft limestone, such as chalk, are best cleaned
with an old penknife, and needles fixed into wooden handles,
and finished off by the application of water with a nail-brush.
Should you have the misfortune to break any specimen in the
process of trimming, it should at once be mended. The most
effectual cement for this purpose is made by simply dissolving
isinglass in acetic acid, or, where the specimen contains much
iron pyrites, and there would be a danger in starting decomposition,
shellac dissolved in spirits of wine. When, however,
neither of these are handy, chalk scraped with a penknife into
a powder, and mixed with gum to the consistency of a thick
paste, answers admirably. Failing this, however, gum alone will
frequently suffice.</p>

<p>The next thing is to place the like kinds together in their
several trays, writing a label, as before, for each tray, but leaving
a blank space at the top for the insertion of the name when
ascertained. The commoner sorts may be named from the
figures of them given in the text-books (see list at the back of the
title page); but failing this, it will be the best plan to seek the
help of any friends who have collections, or to take the fossils to
some museum, and compare them with the named specimens
there exhibited. The label may be laid at the bottom of the
tray with the fossils loose on the top of it, each fossil being
marked with a number corresponding to one on the label.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
Another plan is to fasten the label by one of its edges to the side
of the tray; or, if the fossils are small and mounted on a piece
of card fitting into the tray, it may be gummed with them to the
card.</p>

<p>Now let us take the shells we obtained from the dark-blue
clay, with those and the bones from the old river bed up above.
Gently turn them out of the tins, in which they were packed in
the quarry, on to a paper or the lid of a card-board box, and
with a pair of forceps pick them carefully out of the bran, and
place them in large shallow trays, taking care not to mix those
from the different beds. As we found when collecting them, these
shells are extremely brittle from loss of animal matter, and our
first object is therefore to harden them by some process, so that
they will bear handling. To accomplish this you must get a
saucepan, one of those wire contrivances for holding eggs when
boiling, or a big wire spoon, such as formerly was used for
cooking purposes, a packet of gelatine, and some flat pieces of
tin, which last are easily procured by hammering out an old
mustard or other tin, having previously melted in a gas flame
the solder wherewith it is joined. Half fill the saucepan with
clean water, and put in as much gelatine as when cold will make
a stiff jelly; melt this over the fire, placing the fossils meanwhile
in a warm (not hot) corner of the fire-place; then when the
gelatine is quite dissolved, pile as many of them, whole or in
pieces, into the egg-boiler, or spoon, as it will contain, hold them
for a second in the steam, and then lower them gradually into the
hot gelatine until it completely covers them. Little bubbles of
air will rise and float on the surface. As soon as these cease to
appear, raise the fossils above the surface and allow them to drip;
then pick them up one by one with the forceps, and spread them
out on pieces of tin before the fire, but not too close to it. As
soon as their exterior surfaces become dry, and before the gelatine
gets hard, they should be taken up (they may be handled fearlessly
now), and the superfluous gelatine sticking to the surface gently
removed with a camel's-hair brush dipped in clean warm water;
otherwise, when dry, they present an unnatural varnished appearance,
and have a tendency, on small provocation, to become unpleasantly
sticky.</p>

<p>Small bones may be treated in like manner, but for large
ones, weak glue is to be preferred to gelatine, which is only
suitable for the finer and more delicate objects. Where it is
desired to harden only a few things, it is better to mix the gelatine
in a gallipot, which can be heated when required by standing it
in a saucepan of water on the fire. In any case the gelatine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
need never be wasted, as it will keep almost any length of time,
and can therefore be put by for future use. In default of the
egg-boiler or wire-net spoon, an equally useful plan is to make a
strainer from a piece of perforated zinc by turning up the edges
all around, and attaching copper wire to it by which to lower the
fossils into the gelatine, and raise them again.</p>

<p>When the fossils are quite dry they can be sorted, and those
which have come to pieces may be mended with diamond cement
(<i>i.e.</i> isinglass dissolved in acetic acid), and then properly labelled
and placed in trays, or mounted as previously described.</p>

<p>To the plant remains and Lignite there is little that can be
done beyond trimming them to suit the trays. Should there be
much iron pyrites in the Lignite, it is sure, sooner or later, to
decompose, when all that can be done is to throw it away. In the
case, however, of valuable fruits and seeds, such as those from the
London Clay of Sheppey, it is worth while to preserve them, if
possible, in almost the only way known, viz. by keeping them in
glycerine in wide-mouthed stoppered bottles, or by saturating
them with paraffin.</p>

<a name="tables"></a><p>Having prepared the specimens for the cabinet, the next thing
is to arrange them in proper order. There are several ways of
doing this, but for those who have not had much experience the
following plan will be found the best:&mdash;Group the specimens
according to the formations to which they belong, and arrange
these groups in proper sequence (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_78">Table, <ins title='Corrected - was "p. 16"'>p. 78</ins></a>); then take each
group, and arrange the specimens it comprises in columns.
Beginning at the top of the left-hand corner, place first the
specimens of the rock itself, and under it any examples of
minerals, concretions, etc., found in that rock; next the fossil
plants, if any; and finally, such animal remains as you have
arranged according to their zoological sequence, beginning with
the lower forms (<i>vide</i> <a href="#PRINCIPAL_DIVISIONS_ANIMAL_KINGDOM">Table, <ins title='Correction - was "p. 32"'>p. 94</ins></a>). Unless cramped for room,
each formation should begin a new box, its name being written on
a slip of paper and placed at the head of the columns of trays. A
label setting forth its contents should be fixed outside each of
the boxes, which can then be put away on your cupboard shelves.</p>

<div class="caption2">NOTES ON THE DIFFERENT FORMATIONS MENTIONED IN THE TABLE.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Recent.</span>&mdash;The alluvial deposits of most river valleys and
some estuaries still in course of formation, containing fossil shells
and mammals, all of living species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quaternary</span>, <span class="smcap">Post-Pliocene</span>, or <span class="smcap">Pleistocene</span>.&mdash;1. Including
the raised beaches around the coast, the older gravels of
river valleys and the cave deposits, in all of which the shells are
identical with those living in the rivers and seas of to-day, whilst
the animals are many of them extinct, only a few being now
found living on the spot.</p>

<p>2. The glacial drifts that cover all England north of the
Thames, and which consist of sands, gravels, and clays, full of big
angular stones frequently flattened on one side, scratched and
sometimes polished from having been fixed in moving ice and
forced over other rocks. A very interesting collection of these
"boulders," as they are called, can be easily made, for they belong
to almost every formation in England, and have some of them been
brought from great distances, whilst the number and variety obtainable
from a single pit is astonishing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cainozoic</span>, or <span class="smcap">Tertiary</span>.&mdash;Beds of this age, in England at
all events, are for the most part made up of comparatively soft
rocks, gravels, sands, and clays, and are found in the eastern and
south-eastern counties. They are divided into&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Pliocene, mainly consisting of a series of iron-stained sands,
with abundant shell remains, and locally known as "crags."
The shells are very partial in their distribution, the beds in places
being almost entirely made up of them, whilst in others scarcely
one is to be found. The great majority are of the same species
as many still living. The Pliocene is subdivided into three
groups:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Norwich Crag Series</i>, sometimes called the "Mammaliferous
Crag," as at its base the bones of mastodon, elephant,
hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and some deer have been found.
The shells in it are such as still abound on the beaches of the
eastern coast to-day&mdash;whelks, scallop shells, cockles, periwinkles,
etc.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Red</i> or <i>Suffolk Crag</i>, its two names indicating its
characteristic colour (a dark red-brown) and chief locality.
From the base are obtained the celebrated phosphatic nodules
miscalled "Coprolites," whence is manufactured an artificial
manure, and with them are found the rolled and phosphatized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
bones and teeth of whales, sharks, etc. Amongst the shells the
Reversed Whelks (<i>Fusus contrarius</i>), <i>Fecten opercularis</i>, <i>Pectunculus
glycimeris</i>, several kinds of <i>Mactra</i> and <i>Cardium</i>, etc., are
the commonest. Walton-on-the-Naze, Felixstowe, and Woodbridge
are the best known localities.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>White</i> or <i>Coralline Crag</i> is generally of a pale buff
colour, and is in places almost entirely composed of the remains
of Polyzoa. These (formerly called Corallines, whence the
name Coralline Crag) are beautiful objects for a low-power
microscope, or pocket lens, and are easily mounted in deep cells
on slides. The bits of shell and sand that stick to them should
be carefully removed with the point of a needle. A very large
number of shells occur in this crag: of bivalves, the <i>Pecten</i> is
very abundant, and its valves are frequently thickly grown
over with Polyzoa; <i>Cyprina Islandica</i>, <i>Cardita Senilis</i> are also
plentiful; and of univalves, the genus <i>Natica</i> is common. The
Coralline Crag is best seen in the neighbourhood of Aldborough,
Orford, Woodbridge, and other places in Suffolk.</p>

<p>2. Miocene, possibly represented in the British Isles by a small
patch of clays and lignites at Bovey Tracey.</p>

<p>3. Eocene, divided into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>Upper Eocene</i>, consisting of a series of very fossiliferous
sands, clays, and limestones, exposed in the cliffs at the eastern
and western ends of the Isle of Wight and on the neighbouring
coast of Hampshire. They are partly of freshwater origin, when
they contain the remains of freshwater shells such as <i>Limn&#339;a
Paludina</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>, etc.; partly of marine origin, when shells
belonging to such genera as <i>Ostrea</i>, <i>Venus</i>, etc., take their
place; partly of estuarine, when the brackish water mollusca
are found with bones and scutes of crocodiles and tortoises.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>Middle Eocene</i>, or the <i>Bagshot Beds</i>, composed of sands
and clays. The beautiful coloured sands of Alum Bay, the sands
of the Surrey and Hampstead Heaths, are familiar examples
of the beds of this age. Very few fossils indeed have been
found in them. The clay-beds on the contrary as seen at Barton
and Hordwell on the Hampshire coast and again in the Isle of
Wight, abound with shells belonging to genera such as <i>Conus</i>,
<i>Voluta</i> and <i>Venus</i>, that inhabit warm seas. With them are the
Nummulites, looking externally very like buttons, but on the
inside divided into innumerable chambers in which the complex
animal that formed the nummulite dwelt.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <i>Lower Eocene</i>, the well-known London clay, may almost be
said to compose this division, for the underlying sands, gravels,
and clays are in mass comparatively insignificant. The London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
clay contains plenty of fossils, only as they are disposed in layers
(<i>zones</i>) at a considerable distance apart, they are not often hit
upon. Layers of Septaria or cement-stones are of frequent
occurrence. Sheppy is the great locality for London clay fossils,
as the sea annually washes down large masses of the cliffs and
breaks them up on the beach. A great many
fossil fruits and seeds, remains of crabs, shells
of Nautili, Volutes, and other mollusca, besides
turtles, a species of snake, a bird with teeth,
and a tapir-like animal, have at different times
and in various places been found in this deposit,
which sometimes attains a thickness of
over 400 ft. The "Bognor Rock" is a local
variety of the basement bed of this formation.</p>

<span class="caption">Aturia Zic-zac (from the London clay).</span>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mesozoic</span> or <span class="smcap">Secondary</span> rocks embrace
a series of limestone, clays, sands, and
sandstones that on the whole are well consolidated.
The main mass of them lies to the
west of a line drawn across the map of England
from the mouth of the Tyne, in Northumberland,
southwards to Nottingham, and thence to the mouth
of the Teign in Devonshire. In the south-eastern counties
they underlie the tertiary rocks of the London and Hampshire
basins, as they are called, at no great depth from the
surface. Outlying patches of secondary rocks occur in Scotland,
where they are found near Brora on the east coast, and in the
islands of Skye and Mull on the west. In Ireland they are scantily
represented round about the neighbourhood
of Antrim. The secondary
rocks are divided into&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 227px;">
<img src="images/pg_81b.png" width="227" height="287" alt="Ammonites various (from the chalk)." title="Ammonites various (from the chalk)." /><br />
<span class="caption">Ammonites various (from the chalk).</span>
</div>

<p>1. Cretaceous.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Chalk</i> is too well known
to need description, though technically
it may be described as a soft
white limestone chiefly built up of
the microscopic shells of <i>Foraminifera</i>,
and characterized in its upper
part by nodules and bands of flint.
These flints frequently inclose casts
of fossils (sponges, sea-urchins, etc.),
and sometimes shells themselves.
Fossils, too, are fairly abundant, scattered
throughout the mass. Amongst
the commoner may be noticed the sea-urchins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
such as the "sugar loaf" (<i>Ananchytes</i>) and the heart-shaped
<i>Micraster</i>, the Brachiopods or Lamp-shells (<i>Terebratula</i>,
<i>Rhynchonella</i>), a "Thorny Oyster" (<i>Spondylus spinosus</i>), besides
Ammonites, Belemnites (part of the internal shell of a
kind of cuttle-fish), and the teeth of several species of sharks.
Altogether the chalk is about 1,000 feet thick.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>Upper Greensand</i> is a series of greenish-grey sands and
sandstones. The green colour, on close inspection, is seen to be
due to the presence of innumerable small green grains of a
mineral called glauconite. These are frequently casts of the
chambers of the very same foraminifera
that the chalk is so largely
composed of.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/pg_82a.png" width="192" height="183" alt="Rhynchonella depressa (a Brachiopod, from the Upper Greensand)." title="Rhynchonella depressa (a Brachiopod, from the Upper Greensand)." /><br />
<span class="caption">Rhynchonella depressa (a Brachiopod, from the Upper Greensand).</span>
</div>

<p>Nodules and layers of "chert" (an impure kind of flint) occur
in it, whilst in places it forms a hard rock called "firestone."
The commonest fossils are Brachiopods, very similar to those in the
chalk, a scallop-shell with four strongly marked ribs on it (<i>Pecten
quodricostatus</i>), an oyster with a curved beak (<i>Exogyra columba</i>), and
a pear-shaped sponge (<i>Siphonia pyriformis</i>). The Upper Greensand
is better seen at places in the southern part of the Isle of Wight,
in cliffs on the Dorsetshire coast, in Wiltshire, at Sidmouth, and in some
parts of Surrey.</p>

<span class="caption">Ammonites auritus (from the Gault).</span>
</div>

<p><i>c.</i> <i>Gault</i>, a stiff blue clay abounding
in fossils: Ammonites often retaining their pearly shell; Belemnites,
a bivalve with very deep furrows on it (<i>Inoccramus sulcatus</i>),
and its first cousin (<i>I. concentricus</i>, p. 21), in which the ridge-like markings
correspond with the lines of growth, besides many others, may
be obtained in abundance from it. Layers of phosphatic nodules occur
at irregular intervals. The gault is best studied at East Wear Bay, near
Folkstone; it may also be seen in Dorsetshire, Wiltshire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
Cambridgeshire; lately it has been found as far west as Exeter.</p>

<p>2. Neocomian.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The so-called <i>Lower Green Sand</i>, named in contradistinction
to the <i>Upper Green Sand</i>, includes a
series of iron stained sands, sandstones and clays of great thickness. The
clayey beds are seen at Atherfield in the Isle of Wight, and at Nutfield in
Surrey, while the sandy beds are met with at Speeton, at Folkestone, and
near Reigate. Besides brachiopods and oysters, these beds have furnished
a species of <i>Perna</i> (<i>P. Mulleti</i>), an elongated mussel
(<i>Gervillia anceps</i>), a pretty <i>Trigonia</i> (<i>T. cordata</i>),
some <i>Ammonites</i> and Nautili, with the teeth and bones of big reptiles.
The celebrated "Kentish Rag" and the sponge gravels of Farringdon are of
this age.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>Wealden.</i> The main mass of these rocks occupies the area
inclosed between the North and South Downs, and forms the Valley of the Weald,
whence they take their name. They consist of a series of sands,
sandstones, clays, and shelly limestones that were deposited in
the delta and off the mouth of a big river. The shells in them
belong to freshwater genera, <i>Cyrena</i>, <i>Unio</i>, <i>Paludina</i>, etc. Bones
of a huge lizard that hopped along on his hind legs (<i>Iguanodon</i>),
and those of crocodiles, etc., are from time to time brought to
light. The Wealden rocks occur also on both eastern and
western sides of the Isle of Wight, and in Dorsetshire.</p>

</div>

<p>3. Oolites (or Roe-stones) are so named because the characteristic
limestones of this formation resemble very much the roe of
a fish. The small round grains, of which the typical examples are
built up, when cut or broken through will be seen to be formed of
numerous layers of carbonate of lime, disposed like the coats of
an onion, around some central nucleus, generally a grain of sand,
a fragment of coral, or the shell of one of the Foraminifera.
They are divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Oolites, and
these again are subdivided as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>Upper Oolite.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>Purbeck Beds</i>, a series of fresh-water, with a few estuarine,
or marine beds, which in point of fact connect the deposits we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
are next coming to with the Wealden just passed. They contain
numerous fresh-water shells&mdash;<i>Paludina</i>, <i>Physa</i>, <i>Limn&aelig;a</i>, etc.,
with the microscopic valves of the little fresh-water crustacean
<i>Cypris</i>, whose descendants are abundant in the rivers and lakes of
to-day. An oyster occurs in the "Cinder Bed" and Plant remains
in the "Dirt Beds." But the Purbecks are best known for the
numerous remains of small mammals (<i>Plagiaulax</i>) allied to the
kangaroo rat, at present living in Australia.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Portland Stone and Sand</i>, which come next in order,
are largely quarried in the island whence they take their name.
The quarrymen point out fossils in the stone, which they call
"Horses'-heads" and "Portland screws." The former is the
cast of a <i>Trigonia</i> shell; the latter, that of a tall spired univalve
(<i>Cerithium</i>).</p>

<p>In Wiltshire, a coral (<i>Isastrea oblonga</i>) is found in the sandy
beds, the original calcareous matter of which has been replaced
by silex.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <i>Kimmeridge Clay.</i> This, by the pressure of the rocks subsequently
deposited on it, has in greater part been hardened, and
possesses a tendency to split in thin layers, and hence is termed
by geologists a shale. It is seen at various points between Kimmeridge
on the Dorsetshire coast and the Vale of Pickering in
Yorkshire, and forms broad valleys. The principal fossils in it
are Ammonites, a triangular-shaped oyster (<i>Ostrea deltoidea</i>), and
one resembling a comma (<i>Exogyra virgula</i>).</p>

<p>Middle Oolites.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <i>Coral Rag</i>, or <i>Coralline Oolite</i>, comprises a most variable
set of beds, but principally a series of limestone, with fossil
corals still in the position in which they grew, and resembling
in form the reef-building corals of the Pacific. They rest on</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>Oxford Clay</i>, a dark blue or slate-coloured clay without any
corals, but containing a great many <i>Ammonites</i> and <i>Belemnites</i>.
The <i>Kelloway Rock</i>, a sandy limestone at the base of the Oxford
Clay, is well developed in Yorkshire, and furnishes amongst
other fossils a large belemnite and an oyster (<i>Gryph&aelig;a dilatata</i>).</p>

<p>Lower Oolites.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>Cornbrash</i>, a very shelly deposit of pale-coloured earthy, and
rubbly or sometimes compact limestone with plenty of fossils.
The commonest are Brachiopods, Limas, oysters (<i>Ostrea Marshii</i>),
Pholadomyas and Ammonites. It is best seen in Dorsetshire,
Somersetshire, and near Scarborough in Yorkshire.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>Forest Marble</i> and <i>Bradford Clay</i>. The former is an exceedingly
shelly limestone, often splitting into thin slabs. On the
surfaces of some of the beds may be seen the ripple marks the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
sea made countless years ago, and the tracks of worms and crabs
that dwelt in the mud or crawled on its surface at a time when
it was soft mud. The Bradford clay is a very local deposit, taking
its name from Bradford in Wiltshire, where it is most developed,
and its characteristic fossil is the pear-shaped Encrinite or "stone-lily"
(<i>Apiocrinus Parkinsoni</i>).</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>Great</i> or <i>Bath Oolite</i>, comprising a series of shelly
limestones and fine Oolites, or freestones. The latter are largely
quarried in the neighbourhood of Bath, and used for mantelpieces
and the stone facings of windows. The great Oolite is rich in
univalve mollusca, amongst which may be noted a limpet (<i>Patella
rugosa</i>) and the handsome, tall-spired <i>Nerin&aelig;a Voltzii</i>, numerous
bivalves belonging to the genera <i>Pholadomya Trigonia</i>, <i>Ostrea</i> (<i>O.
gregaria</i>), and <i>Pecten</i>, besides Brachiopods (<i>Terebratula digona</i>,
which looks very like a sack of flour, and <i>T. perovalis</i>, etc.).</p>

<p>At the base of the Great Oolite are the "Stonesfield slates,"
so-called&mdash;a series of thin shelly Oolites, etc., that split readily into
very thin slabs. They are principally of interest to geologists
on account of the discovery in them of the remains of small
insect-feeding and possibly pouched mammals. With these are
associated the bones of that big reptile the <i>Megalosaurus</i>; the
flying lizards called Pterodactyles; fish teeth and spines; lamp
shells; oysters, a <i>Trigonia</i> (<i>T. impressa</i>); and the impressions
of insects, including a butterfly, and of plants.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <i>Fullers' Earth</i>, a clayey deposit occurring in the southwestern
parts of England, but not in the north. It abounds with
a small oyster (<i>O. acuminata</i>) and Brachiopods (e.g. <i>Terebratula
ornithocephala</i>), etc.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <i>Inferior Oolite</i> (including the Midford Sands). As these beds
are followed across the country from the south-west of England
to Yorkshire, they are found to change greatly in character.
Limestone and marine beds in the south are replaced by sandy and
estuarine beds in the north. Amongst other fossils from beds of
this age may be found several Echinoderms, a crinkly lamp shell
(<i>Terebratula frimbriata</i>), and a spiny one (<i>Rhynchonella spinosa</i>),
bivalves belonging to the Genera <i>Ostrea</i>, <i>Trigonia</i>, <i>Pholadomya</i>,
etc., and some very handsome Ammonites (e.g. <i>A. Humphresianus</i>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Lias.</p>

<p>This for the most part consists of very regular alternations
of argillaceous (clayey) limestone and clay, or shale. It is of
great thickness, and hence for convenience has been divided
into (a) <i>Upper Lias</i>, (b) <i>Middle Lias</i> or <i>Marl-stone</i>, and (c)
<i>Lower Lias</i>. A large number of fossils are to be found in it.
Lyme Regis and Whitby are perhaps the best known localities;
the former, on account of the great number of specimens obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
of the huge fish-lizard (<i>Ichthyosaurus</i>, p. 24), and long-necked
<i>Plesiosaurus</i> (p. 25), besides numberless fish; whilst the latter
is renowned for its jet (or fossilized wood) and
its "snake-stones" (<i>Ammonites</i>), concerning
which curious old stories are told. <i>Ammonites</i>
are plentiful in the Lias, which has been subdivided
into zones, or layers, named after the
ammonite occurring in greatest numbers in that
particular zone. There is one thin limestone
band in the Marlstone composed entirely of the
shells of <i>Ammonites planicostatus</i>. A curious
kind of oyster (<i>Gryph&aelig;a incurva</i>), locally known
as the devil's toenail, a huge <i>Lima</i> (<i>L. gigantea</i>),
a magnificent Encrinite (<i>Extracrinus Briareus</i>),
and numerous other fossils, are also to be obtained
by patient search.</p>

<span class="caption">Belemnitas elongatus (from the Lias).</span>
</div>

<p>5. Rh&aelig;tic, Penarth Beds, or White Lias.</p>

<p>These beds are not of any considerable thickness,
but are very persistent, and of great interest,
inasmuch as they yield the remains of
the oldest known mammal (<i>Microlestes</i>), a small
insect-feeder. They are composed of limestones,
shales and marls (<i>i.e.</i> limey clays), and are best
studied in Somersetshire and Dorsetshire. The
"landscape marble" belongs to this formation,
which also contains a bone bed, or thin layer
made up of the bones and teeth, etc., of fish.
Shells are not numerous, though the casts of
one species (<i>Avicula contorta</i>) is plentiful.</p>

<p>6. Trias, or New Red Sandstone, a thick
series of sandstones and marls, the great mass
of which forms the subsoil of the western midland
counties, Birmingham being nearly in the
centre, thence they extend in three directions,
one branch passing towards the north-west,
through Cheshire, to the sea at Liverpool, reappearing
on the coast line of Lancashire, Westmoreland,
and Cumberland, where it also forms
the Valley of the Eden. Another branch extends
through Derby and York to South Shields,
whilst the third may be traced southwards in
isolated patches down into Devonshire.</p>

<p>There are scarcely any fossils in it, but in Worcestershire and
Warwickshire the bivalve shell of a small crustacean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
(<i>Estheria minuta</i>) occurs in the upper beds; whilst now and again the
teeth and bones of some strange amphibians (<i>Labyrinthodon</i>), or
the impressions of their feet (<i>Cheirotherium</i>) where they
crawled on the then soft mud of the foreshore, are found. The
Trias is divided into Upper Trias or Keuper, and Lower Trias or
Bunter. The middle beds (Muschelkalk), which are found
in Germany, where they contain plenty of fossils, are wanting in
this country. In the lower beds of the Keuper, layers of rock
salt, sometimes of great thickness, occur, whilst casts (called
pseudomorphs) of detached salt-crystals are found abundantly in
the sandy marls. Northwich, Nantwich, Droitwich, and several
other towns in Cheshire and Worcestershire, are famed for their salt works,
the salt being either mined or pumped up as brine from these beds.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 352px;">

<span class="caption">Ceratites nodosus (from the Muschelkalk).</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;ozoic or Primary.</span>&mdash;Beds of this age generally possess
a more crystalline and slaty structure than any of those already
mentioned, are usually more highly inclined and disturbed, and
form for the most part more elevated ground. They are the
principal store-houses of our mineral wealth, containing as they
do coal, iron, and other metals. The Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks are
found in England to the north and west of the secondary series,
beneath which they disappear when traced to the south-east.
Wales, and the greater part of Scotland and Ireland, consist of
beds of this age.</p>

<p>1. Permian. Under this term are included beds of red sandstones
and marls, closely resembling those of Trias, and like
them containing but few fossils, as well as a very fossiliferous
limestone, known as the Magnesian Limestone, from the
abundance of magnesia it contains. A pretty polyzoan
(<i>Fenestella retiformis</i>), a spiny brachiopod (<i>Productus horridus</i>),
various genera of fish, chiefly found in a marl state underlying the
limestone, some Labyrinthodonts and plant remains, are the principal
forms met with in this formation.</p>

<p>2. Carboniferous. This, from a commercial point of view, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
the most important of all the formations, comprising as it does
the coal-bearing strata. It is subdivided into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>Coalmeasures</i>, a series of sandstones and shales with which
are interstratified the seams of coal, varying in thickness from six
inches to as much in one instance as thirty feet.</p>

<p>Coal is the carbonized remains of innumerable plants, chiefly
ferns and gigantic clubmosses, that grew in swamps bordering on
the sea-coast of the period. Each coal seam is underlain by a
bed of clay called "under-clay," containing the roots of the
plants that grew on it. Some of the best impressions of
ferns, etc., are to be obtained in the shaley beds forming the
roof of the coal seam; many good specimens, however, are to be
got by searching the refuse heap at the pit's mouth. Besides
plants, the remains of fish are abundant in some of the beds of
shale. And in Nova Scotia the bones of air-breathing reptiles
and land snails have been discovered. Cockroaches and other
insects were also denizens of the carboniferous forests.</p>

<p>The following are the principal coalfields:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Northumberland and Durham coalfield.</li>
<li>South Lancashire coalfield.</li>
<li>Derbyshire coalfield.</li>
<li>Leicestershire and Staffordshire coalfields.</li>
<li>South Wales coalfield.</li>
<li>Bristol and Somerset coalfields.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>Millstone grit</i> or <i>Farewell-rock</i>. The former term explains
itself, the latter designation has been applied to it in the southern
districts, because when it is reached, then good-bye to all workable
coal-seams.</p>

<p>It consists of coarse sandstones, shales, and conglomerates with
a few small seams of coal. Fossils are not very common in
it.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Yoredale Rocks, a series of flagstones, gritstones, limestones
and shales, with seams of coal, occurring in the northern counties.
It is underlain by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <i>Carboniferous</i> or <i>Mountain Limestone</i>, which in places is
upwards of 1,000 feet thick, and full of fossils. The stems of
encrinites, or "stone-lilies," corals, brachiopods (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Productus</i>,
<i>Orthis</i>, etc.), and Mollusca, including some Cephalopods, like
<i>Goniatites</i> and the straight Nautilus (<i>Orthoceras</i>), with fish
teeth, etc., go to compose this tough, bluish-grey limestone which
is largely quarried for marble mantlepieces, etc.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> The <i>Tuedian group</i> in the north, and <i>Lower Limestone
Shale</i> in the south, follow next, and consist of shales, sandstones,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
limestones, and conglomerates, varying greatly in different
districts, and containing few fossils.</p>

<p>3. Devonian or Old Red Sandstone. To this age are assigned
a perplexing series of strata, the principal members of which
consist of (<i>a</i>) a thick limestone, well seen in the cliffs and
marble quarries of south Devon, and full of fossil-corals (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Favosites polymorpha</i> [or <i>cervicornis</i>]) Brachiopods, and Mollusca,
etc.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> A series of sandstones, slates, and limestones in North Devon
containing Trilobites (<i>Phacops</i>, <i>Bronteus</i>, etc.), Brachiopods, and
other fossils.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>Old Red Sandstone</i> of Wales, the North of England, and
Scotland, consisting of red and grey sandstone and marly beds,
with remains of fish.</p>

<p>These fish, unlike most now living, were more or less covered
with hard external plates, and possessed merely a cartilaginous
skeleton. In one set of individuals, indeed (<i>Pterichthys</i>), the
armour plates formed quite a little box. These creatures propelled
themselves by means of two arm-like flippers, rather than
fins. They were but a few inches long, and appear pigmies in
contrast to the strange half-lobster-like <ins title='Correction - was "crustucean"'>crustacean</ins> <i>Pterygotus</i>,
that lived with them, and attained sometimes as much as five
feet in length.</p>

<p>4. Silurian. Named by Sir Roderick Murchison after a tribe of
Ancient Britons that dwelt in that part of Wales, where these rocks
were first observed. Some of Murchison's Lower Silurian beds
were included by Professor Sedgwick in his Cambrian, of which
we shall have to speak next; and as these two geologists never
could agree on a divisional line between their respective formations,
and since succeeding observers have followed sometimes
one and sometimes the other method of classification, considerable
confusion has resulted. Here, however, for several reasons,
we propose to follow Sedgwick's arrangement; and hence, under
the term Silurian, retain only Murchison's Upper beds. They
consist of a series of sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates, shales,
limestones, etc.</p>

<p>Amongst the more important fossils, which are very abundant
in the limestones, are various corals (<i>e.g.</i> the Chain-coral
<i>Halysites</i>), Star-fish, Crinoids, Trilobites (<i>Phacops</i>, etc.), Polyzoa,
Brachiopods and Mollusca, especially Cephalopoda (<i>Orthoceras</i>,
<i>Nautilus</i>, etc.).</p>

<p>These rocks occur principally in the border land between
England and Wales, and the adjacent counties; but are also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
represented in Westmoreland, Scotland, and Ireland. Their
principal subdivisions are given in the Table on p. 16.</p>

<span class="caption">Orthoceras subannulatum (from the Silurian).</span>
</div>

<p>5. Cambrian. Under this term, derived from the old name
for Wales, are included many sandstones, grits, slates and flags,
with here and there a limestone band. They form the greater
part of the western counties of Wales, where they rise to a considerable
height above the sea level. The highest hills of
Westmoreland and more than half of Scotland are composed of
beds of this age.</p>

<p>The fossils, save in the limestone bands, are not easy to find,
but in places they are fairly abundant. Brachiopods are far
more numerous than the Mollusca properly so-called. Of these,
the genus <i>Orthis</i> was most abundant at about the close of this
period. Certain beds of this age have received the name of
Lingula Flags, owing this prevalence in them of the curious
Brachiopod <i>Lingula</i> so like the species now living in some of the
warm seas of the tropics. The Trilobites included several forms,
and one species (<i>Paradoxides Davidis</i>) attained the length of
nearly two feet. A few star-fish, some Hydrozoans (<i>Graptolites</i>),
and the tubes and casts of Annelides and tracks of Trilobites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
complete the list of more remarkable fossils. The subdivisions
of the Cambrian rocks will be found in the table on p. 16.</p>

<p>6. Pre-Cambrian.&mdash;Near St. David's Head and some other
places in Wales, in Anglesea, Shropshire, etc., some yet older
rocks have been found. They are probably for the most part of
volcanic origin, but they have been so much changed since they
were first deposited, and as hitherto no fossils have been found
in them, little is known concerning them.</p>

<p>Parts of the western coast of Northern Scotland and the Hebrides
are composed of a crystalline rock called Gneiss, and supposed
to be the oldest member of the British strata. No fossils
have been found in it.</p>

<span class="caption">Skull of Deinotherium giganteum, a huge extinct animal, related to the elephants (from the Miocene of Germany).</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Volcanic Rocks.</span> Although there are fortunately no volcanoes
to disturb the peace of our country at the present day,
there is abundant evidence of their existence in the past. Not
only are some of the beds, especially those of Paleozoic age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
composed of the dust and ashes thrown out of volcanoes, with
here and there a lava flow now hardened into solid rock, but
the stumps of the volcanoes themselves are left to tell the tale.
The cones indeed are gone, carried off piecemeal by the rain and
frosts, and other destructive agencies, in the course of countless
ages: not so the once fluid rock within; <i>that</i> cooled down into
Granite, and though originally below the surface, it now, owing
to the removal of the overlying softer strata, forms raised ground
overlooking the surrounding country. The granite masses of
Cornwall, of Dartmoor, in the south-west of Mt. Sorrel; the
variety called Syenite at Malvern and Charnwood Forest; the
Basalts of the Cheviot Hills and of Antrim; the volcanic rocks
of Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh, and of the islands of Skye and
Mull, etc., are examples of this class of rock. They are of different
ages, and belong to different periods of the earth's history,
from early Pal&aelig;ozoic down to Miocene times.</p>

<p>As there appear to be section and subsections in the second and third units (Shells and Fossils) of this book, Tables of Contents were created for the electronic edition. A number of the images were moved where they split paragraphs. There is a reference to a <a name="missing_24"></a><a href="#Ancylus">Figure 24</a> for <i>Ancylus</i>; but no Fig. 24 was included. The reference to Fig. 26 for <i>Bullid&aelig;</i> was assumed to be a reference to Fig. 14. Bulla ampulla.</p>

<p>With the exception of the following items, all page number references in the original text were retained. There are references to <a href="#tables">two tables on Page 77</a>. The first was listed a "<i>vide</i> Table, p. 16" and the second as "<i>vide</i> Table, p. 32" which appear to refer to the tables on page 78 and 94 respectively. The page references were corrected.</p>

<p>Species name are assumed to be correct for the time of publication (ca. 1886).
For example, <i>Charychium</i> is today listed as <i>Carychium</i>.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
